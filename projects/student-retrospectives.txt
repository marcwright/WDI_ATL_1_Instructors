Don’t use things like Bootstrap or Devise unless I am sure that it will end up being more helpful than hurtful...more research surrounding technologies 

Investing time to go back and read docs can ultimately be more productive than trying to find a quick fix on StackOverflow...javascript!!

I would like to be more aware of when something isn’t going to work out quickly, move it to the back burner and move to something that I may be able to complete effeciently.

Splitting between two factions of front end and back end made us more separated and less able to realize what was going on for the other respective end.

Our end product is mostly functional, but not completely reliable.

We should have tested things on Heroku earlier and more consistently.

Focused a lot on making the product pretty and less about making it functional

Focus more on MVP rather than views.

Establishing firmer expectations for everyone’s working hours and workload.
