#Rails 4 / MongoDB

###Skill Drills
- Get familiar with the basic CRUD controller actions! In your own words, write brief descriptions of, match HTTP verbs to, and write sample routes for:
	- Index
	- New
	- Create
	- Show
	- Edit
	- Update
	- Destroy 
- Go back to the beers app, and delete your scaffolded controller (breweries). Now, write CRUD actions from scratch!
- Add authentication (with BCrypt) to one of the in-class labs that doesn't already have it.

###Mini-Projects

- Write a basic CRUD app that allows users to create burrito orders at Chipotle (and see a list of other orders, edit their posts, and delete them). Try to keep text inputs minimal (name of orderer, etc) and focus on making that form more realistic (checkboxes for optional ingredients, radio buttons or dropdowns for things like meats that are one-per-order, etc).
- Make a mad libs app! No need for full CRUD (no edits or deletes), but take more inputs in your form than you'll use in your view (a funny story that you write) and surprise your users with what shows up.
