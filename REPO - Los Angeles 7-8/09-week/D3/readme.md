#D3 -- Data Driven Documents (Intro!)

[D3](http://d3js.org/) is a fantastic, robust JavaScript library that lets you pair data with visuals. It's the brainchild of Mike Bostock, who developed it while working as a researcher at the Stanford Vis Group (and who currently maintains, expands, and teaches it as a member of the New York Times' graphics team).

##What we're going to do today:

###Lesson time:

- Relax. Let's have some fun.
- Stay off the Rails for now (D3 comes in via JavaScript, so it's not important to use it in an exclusively Rails context -- you can fold it into your project very easily later!)
- Talk about why and when D3 can be useful
- [Walk through](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_LA_7-8/tree/master/09_week/D3/Walkthrough/index.html) some basic D3
- Inspect elements and change things around

###Lab time: 

- We've got a [template page](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_LA_7-8/tree/master/09_week/D3/Walkthrough/template.html) that you can use as your playground. It's set up in the same general format as the walkthrough pages -- HTML up top, D3 magic below, button to toggle the magic. (Feel free to make your own page as well!)
- Have FUN. Make shapes, make graphs, make a lot of *weird stuff* with data.
- Need some ideas?
	- Try making a set of circles with radii that correspond to data points.
	- Try making a Venn diagram. 
	- Try using JSON data instead of an array to populate a dataset (hint: this is what you'll need to do if you choose to use D3 in your Project 3!).
- If you need a little kick start, Mike Bostock has collected a [wide range of tutorials](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Tutorials) on his wiki.
- Need guidance about using D3 in your Rails app? Come talk to us. (Hint: you may not need it for Project 3, but it's a super way to spiff up your Project 4)

###More:

- D3 is a powerful library with tons of potential (its creator uses it at his day job to create super spiffy infographics, and many other developers use it to communicate information in novel or more expressive manners).
- We'll be coming back to this during weeks 10-12 as an advanced topic. There's a lot you can do with complex graphs, mathematical structures, and maps!
- Play around in the [documentation](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki) if you'd like to learn more; we'd love to see some Project 3s and Project 4s with D3! 
- You'll be getting a bunch of neato D3 stuff in this week's email newsletter :)
