#Test Driven Development with RSpec
###Objectives
Students will be able to use RSpec for TDD.

##Pairs
Partner up!

Let's do some test-driven development.

- Understand the problem and its desired solution
- Write the test(s)
- Write some Ruby (make it work)

###The problem
Given an array of integers, count the pairs of integers whose difference is *k*. A pair is composed of an integer value and the next integer value in the array.

Given the sample array [1, 5, 3, 4, 2] and the difference 2, the solution should be 2.

Given the difference 3 and the array [1, 2, 5, 2, 10, 8, 11], the function should return 3.
