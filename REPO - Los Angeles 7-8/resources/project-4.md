## FOURTH PROJECT

It's the final countdown! With three projects under your belt, you're ready to embark on something BIG. 

The objective of this project is to:

* Apply knowledge and skills learned throughout the course
* Push yourself further, and try something ambitious
* Practice Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) /  Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Ideally, you'll use the final three weeks of the program to venture into new territory -- go deeper with advanced Rails topics, explore new stacks, try out libraries and APIs that you haven't used yet, try different testing frameworks, etc.

You may work in teams of up to three students, but we'll be expecting more challenging projects out of teams than individuals. Teams will be held to the same standards of project comprehension as in Project 3 -- each individual should be able to speak confidently and accurately about how the group's app worked, and note contributions from teammates.

If you'd like to augment a previous project (for example, your project 2 or project 3), you must build out a *different* aspect of that app, from scratch. Possible options include building an admin dashboard for an earlier project that was entirely client-facing, or incorporating a significant AngularJS feature set in a project that did not previously have it. Students who pitch extensions of earlier projects will be expected to speak to the substantial effort involved in the Project 4 version of the app.


## CORE REQUIREMENTS

Make sure to do all of the following with your app. These core requirements are less restrictive than the past three project requirements, but they're still very important.

* Custom backend (Rails**) with storage to a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or something else, but you must store some data in some manner!)
* Use BDD and/or TDD
* Produce user stories and scenarios
* Track progress with Pivotal Tracker
* Deploy your app to Heroku (or another server)
* Complete all project deliverables (specified below)

** Students must get instructor approval before using other stacks in a final project. All project pitches must involve a web application (Sorry, no iOS/Android for your final project! You may deploy to Phonegap but it will not be used as part of the evaluation of your app).


## CHALLENGE ADD-ONS

These are for extra credit! Keep in mind that we're going to be looking for your core requirements first.

* Solve a real problem (do research, have users, make something that isn't a novelty app)
* Use a technology not taught in class (Node, Ember, Meteor, etc**) 
* Teach a lesson module on a skill or technique you've mastered (multiple-file uploads, kanban, etc)
* Make more than one final project (bonus: make yourself a portfolio site to show off your work!)

** If you make another app using a different stack (for example, if your main Project 4 is on Rails but you also make a Node mini-project), you are welcome to demo both.



## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

####Project Plan deliverables:

* Project pitch -- use the Inception Deck to plan out your project, and pitch it to the instructional team
* Stories in Pivotal Tracker -- what do your objectives look like, broken down into unit-sized chunks?
* Project wireframes
* Project GitHub repo


####Completed Project deliverables:

* Link to Heroku (or other) deployed project
* Link to source code on GitHub
* Self-evaluation based on Final Project Rubric


## TIMELINE

* Project cycle: Weeks 10-12
* Demo day: last day of class (Thursday, June 26)


## Things to keep in mind
Make sure that your code is:

* Tested. Be thorough and smart about your testing; write tests first and code second. 
* Well-formatted. Are you indenting well? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* Well-commented. Will I understand what is going on in each block or function?
* Clear. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* Deployed and on GitHub. It's required for this project.


Weâ€™ll also be looking at:

* Planning. Did you think through your project and try to solve a real/tangible problem?
* Documentation. Is there a README? If your app is very robust or complicated, or can be built upon by other developers, is there a wiki?
* Quality of decision-making. Can you stand behind your design and coding choices? Can you think of future improvements to your app?
* Your ability to pick up new technologies and push yourselves. What did you do that took you out of your comfort zone?
