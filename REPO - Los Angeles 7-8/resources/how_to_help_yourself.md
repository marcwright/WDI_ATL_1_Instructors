#How to Help Yourself

###step 1 - Stack Overflow

Post your question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). 

Go set up an anonymous account, ...DO IT! :)

**Talk - out - the - question:**

Going through this process will cause you to rethink about your problem step by step

Often times you will find that thinking it out-loud will help you figure it out

if at that point you still need help...post the question on StackOverflow and move on to step 2...

###step 2 - IRC

irc is a network of chat servers older than the World Wide Web (1991) itself it was born in 1988.
Their are many many tools to access it. My personal favorite currently is an open source tool...

[Colloguy](http://colloquy.info/downloads.html)

install this sucker...

Once you have that. Right-click it to run it on your mac.

Now go to "Window/connections" or just press command+1

press the "new" icon and type...

	server   = irc.freenode.net
	port     = 6667
	Nickname = YOUR_NICKNAME
	
Don't have a nickname? go here...

	https://freenode.net/faq.shtml#nicksetup
	
But how do I X,Y or Z ?
Now read the FAQs

###step 3 - Stay connected to each other

I love this app because it stays out of my way.

Stay connected to each other via...

[Adium](https://adium.im/)

Once installed go to adium/preferences or press command+,

add an account (I like to use my gmail account)

(you can add as many accounts related to as many systems as you like)

Now go back to the menu and look for "contact/add contact" or press command+d

add some friends emails

Note: I've found this works very well if your friends are on gmail

now you have a nice little out-of-the-way connection to EVERYONE

good fortune to you,
