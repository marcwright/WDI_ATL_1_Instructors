# In the notes, examples and cheatsheets I'll provide, 
# I will be using a few conventions 
# to make it easy to see the results of expressions. 
# To show the results of a line, we use the following notation 

3 + 10 # => 13
my_variable = 4
my_variable # => 4

# Note the "hash rocket"... # =>

# Make sure you have the Ruby Markers[1] plugin installed

# To create a hash rocket, at the end of this line, type "#" then press "tab"

# (using Sublime text) the shortcut for creating this is ... alt + shift + u

10 + 20 # => 30

# This shows what that line evaluates to, and in the case of a line with just 
# a variable on it (line 7 above), shows the value
# of the object it refers to.

# For more complicated output, such as from a print statement, it will appear below the code.

# Note: for Sublime Text 2 run "gem install rcodetools" on the command line (terminal).

# Then open package manager and look for "Ruby markers"
