# What are Conditionals (Learning Objectives)

# when you need to make a choice between one or more outcomes in any given situation...
# QUESTION: When would YOU use one?

# Ruby If/Else Statement
#
# if expressions are used for conditional execution...

# Syntax:
		# if conditional [then]
		# 	  code...
		# [elsif conditional [then]
		# 	  code...]...
		# [else
		# 	  code...]
		# end

# So let's say you want to do something conditionally

		if 4 == (2 + 2)
		  "I get evaluated"   
		else
		  "I don't :("       
		end

# So an if statement executes code if the conditional is true. 
# If the conditional is not true, the code specified in the else clause is executed.

# But what if you have more than two choices to evaluate...?
