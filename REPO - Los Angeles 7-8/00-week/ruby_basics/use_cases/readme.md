#Zero Week Ruby Lessons

Here are some quick code samples from Zero Week:


##[Hello, World](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_LA_5-6/blob/master/00-week/ruby%20basics/helloworld.rb)

The very first Ruby program! Prints "Hello, world!" to the console.


##[Hello, World (Advanced)](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_LA_5-6/blob/master/00-week/ruby%20basics/helloworld-advanced.rb)

Brings a few new topics into our base "Hello, world" app -- standard input/output, variables, upcase, Time.now, conditionals (if/else), string interpolation.

Asks the user's name, age, and whether they've had a birthday yet this year; greets the user and tells them their birth year.


##[Barkeep](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_LA_5-6/blob/master/00-week/ruby%20basics/barkeep.rb)

Conditionals with if/else. Asks the user for their age, then lets them into the bar if they're over 21, or rejects them if they're under 21.
	
##[Guess](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_LA_5-6/blob/master/00-week/ruby%20basics/guess.rb)

Cases. Asks the user to choose A, B, C, or D, then outputs a response based on their answer (specific statements for A, B, and C; generic response for all other answers).

##[GuessNum](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_LA_5-6/blob/master/00-week/ruby%20basics/guessnum.rb)

A guess-the-number game that uses loops and conditionals. Sets a random "answer" from 1-10, then prompts user for a guess. When the user guesses correctly, exits; until then, keeps prompting the user for new guesses, and telling them whether their incorrect guess is too high or too low. *Thanks, students, for your contribution to this code sample!*

##[Multiply Your Life](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_LA_5-6/blob/master/00-week/ruby%20basics/multiply_your_life.rb)

Lorin's times-tables exercise using for loops.
