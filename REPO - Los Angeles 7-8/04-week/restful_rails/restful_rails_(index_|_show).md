#RESTful Rails (index | show)

###OBJECTIVE
To rebuild the same app from the day before. This time we will only go up to index and show. Students will be able to drive the code 25-50% of the time in this go around. The objective is to learn by repetition what is happening in our app and how the model controller and view are relating to one another.
	
###WHAT DID YOU LEARN YESTERDAY?


	
###CONNECTION TO THE BIG GOAL
(aka why we doing this?)

We want to spend the entire class time focusing on two things.

One - what is happening with our view ...index... and how we can get our controller "beans_controller.rb" to interact with it.

Two - what is happening with our view ... show...and how we can get our controller "beans_controller.rb" to interact with it.

	
1. “I Do” - CODE (10 min.) 	 
	
2. “We Do” - CHAT ABOUT CODE (2 min.)
