Write a function:

    def solution(arr)

that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array arr of N integers, returns the minimal positive integer that does not occur in arr.

For example, given:

    arr[0] = 1
    arr[1] = 3
    arr[2] = 6
    arr[3] = 4
    arr[4] = 1
    arr[5] = 2

the function should return 5.


Assume that:

- N is an integer within the range 1..100,000
- each element of array arr is an integer within the range -2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647

Elements of input arrays can be modified.
