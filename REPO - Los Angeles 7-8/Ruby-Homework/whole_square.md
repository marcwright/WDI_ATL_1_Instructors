An integer P is a whole square if it is a square of some integer Q; i.e. if P = Q<sup>2</sup>.

Write a function:

    def solution(a, b)

that, given two integers **a** and **b**, returns the number of whole squares within the interval [a..b]
For example, given a = 4 and b = 17, the function should return 3, because there are three squares of integers in that interval [4..17], namely 4 = 2<sup>2</sup>, 9 = 3<sup>2</sup>, and 16 = 4<sup>2</sup>.

Assume that:
- **a** and **b** are integers within the range [-2,147,483,648..-2,147,483,647].
