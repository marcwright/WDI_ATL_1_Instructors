#99 Bottles of Beer
I had the privilege of driving my in-laws to Central California over the past weekend. Amongst the passengers was a baby, which had to be entertained during the long ride. Amongst the songs her mom sang to her, there was "99 bottles of beer on the wall". Since it's kind of a repetitive song I figured, we could use some Ruby and a computer-generated voice to "sing" that song.

It starts like this:
> 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
 
> Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall...

The verse repeats with the new number of bottles of beer on the wall.

And the end (no infinite loop, because that's bad for your health) could end like this:
> No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.

> Go to the store to buy some more, only to get mugged...


Your task is to write a short Ruby program that prints out the song.

**Bonus:** Make the computer "sing" the song for you.
