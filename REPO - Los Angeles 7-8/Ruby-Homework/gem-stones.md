GA has found a variety of rocks. Each rock is composed of different elements, and each element is represented by a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z'. An element may be found several times in a rock. An element is called a *G-element* if it appears at least one time in all of the rocks.

We provide you with the list of rocks and their compositions. Your job is to show the amount of G-elements that are present in those rocks.

###Input Format
The first line consists of N, the number of rocks.
Each of the next N lines contain rocks' composition. Each composition consists of lowercase letters of English alphabet.

###Output Format
