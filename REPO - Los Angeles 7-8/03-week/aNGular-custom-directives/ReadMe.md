#Angular Custom Directives

One of the coolest features of AngularJS is the ability to write custom directives.

And we'll be doing just that today. It's going to get sticky!

By extending and customizing how the browser behaves with regard to the HTML, directives let the application developer, or designer, focus their attention on what the application should do, or look like, in a declarative manner, rather than on programming low level interactions with the DOM. This makes the development process faster, more maintainable, and most importantly more fun!

The job of a directive is to modify the DOM structure and to link the scope to the DOM. This means manipulating and binding DOM nodes based on data in the scope, but also binding DOM events to call methods on the scope.
