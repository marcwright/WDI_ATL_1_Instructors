#How to get code help

Their are many ways to get help online besides "Googling" it.
I'll list some favorites here. I'll also encourage using anonymous accounts where I think it's best to. It's the wild wild west folks so be mindful.

##Each Other

did you know you can pair program with a pal remotely?

I love a tool called "join.me" for this. I don't know who the heck owns this so don't use it for critical, super secret, code. But for everything else GO FOR it!

[join.me](www.join.me)

##Instructors

Of course, nuff said.


##StackOverflow

create an anonymous account of SO. 

[Stack Overflow](stackoverflow.com)

##IRC

There are live chat rooms with developers from all over the world online 24/7.

Here's a cheat sheet of irc commands...

I like to use a tool called colloquy to connect to them..it's free and open source.

**CAUTION: don't except down loadable files from anyone on IRC.**
