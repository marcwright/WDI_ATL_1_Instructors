I love going to the movies, but I'm only interested in excellent movies, meaning movies that are rated 90% or above at the time of their release. Movie show pages should show nearby showtimes. Users should be able to save movies they're interested in.  to a watchlist, which is a sort of checklist. Once they've seen the movie, they can add a review for posterity.

Can I request that movie showtime information be sent straight to my phone with local showtimes? How would that work?
