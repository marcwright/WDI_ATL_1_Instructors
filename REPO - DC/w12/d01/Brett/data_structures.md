#### Lists & Arrays
* What is a Linked List?
  - In computer science, a linked list is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each node is composed of a data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence; more complex variants add additional links. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence.
  * How does insertion and deletion work?
  - adding and removing nodes along with reference values
* What is the difference between a Linked List and an Array?
  - Arrays have fixed size, retrieval is fast but insertion and deletion are slow due to having to shift elements.
  - Linked lists are dynamic in size and no shifting of data when inserting or deleting.
* What is the time complexity to search?
  * A linked list?
  - O(n) - have to traverse down the list
  * An unsorted array?
  - 0(n)
  * A sorted array?
  - O(log n)
