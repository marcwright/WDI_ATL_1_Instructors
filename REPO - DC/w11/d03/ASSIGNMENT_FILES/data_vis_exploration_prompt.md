## Data Visualization Exploration

For the next day and a half, you're going to partner up and create a simple but hopefully beautiful data visualization to include in your portfolio. What you build and what tools you use are to you (but don't take forever in making these decisions).

#### Guidance

1. Find one or two datasets that you find interesting.
1. Think of ways in which this data can be dynamically presented, and ways in which users can *engage* with that data (consider the user interface).
1. Once you've settled on a visualization/wireframe, implement it. You don't have to use D3.js, but know that it has a rich collection of open-source examples. (And it's the current hotness, so it looks great in a portfolio.)
