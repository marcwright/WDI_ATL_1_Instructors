# Example DNA String

dna = "GCTCGATCGATCTAGCTAGCATGATAATCGATGATCTAGCCGGGCCCTTAGCGGATCTAGCATCGATCGACTCGATCGAGCGCTAGCTACGATCAG"

## Questions:

##### 1) How many unique bases (letters)?

##### 2) Given a base (ie "A") return the number of bases of that type

##### 3) Return a hash with the count of each of the bases

##### 4) Write a method that returns the reverse complement of a DNA string.

The reverse complement of a DNA string is the string formed by reversing the symbols, then taking the complement of each symbol.
- Complements: G <=> C; A <=> T
- the reverse complement of "GTCA" is "TGAC"
