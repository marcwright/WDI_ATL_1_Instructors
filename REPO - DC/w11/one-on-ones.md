# 1:1's
We are going to have 1:1 meetings this week to discuss your post-course goals, and how you can fill in the gaps in your knowledge and maximize your learning in a non-wdi environment. 

### Some things to think about:

* __Your Goals:__ What are your goals for life after the course?
* __Your Perceived Weak Spots:__ What material do you feel you barely retained and need work on?
* __What components of web development did you really like?:__ Start thinking about what turns you on, because that's probably what you'll excel at just by nature of enjoying the work

### The schedule:
