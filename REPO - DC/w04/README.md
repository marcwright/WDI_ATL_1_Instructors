#Week 4 - Intro to Web Applications

###What did we do last week?
- We took a deeper dive into how to design schemas and use SQL to access and manipulate our data. We learned ActiveRecord, which allows us to access our database without writing much SQL and maps our objects to our database tables. Toward the end of the week, we built our first web applications using Sinatra.
