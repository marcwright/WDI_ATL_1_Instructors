# MV-Compare

## Libraries and Frameworks

- A **library** performs specific, well-defined operations.

- A **framework** is a skeleton over which an application's business logic is fleshed out. The skeleton provides core support for the application's specific operations.

### Research facts:

- **Short description of the tool**
  Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.

   Backbone.js aims to provide the common foundation that data-rich web applications with ambitious interfaces require — while very deliberately avoiding painting you into a corner by making any decisions that you're better equipped to make yourself.

- **Who made it?** (if available)
  Jeremy Ashkenas, who is also the creator of Underscore.js and Coffeescript. He works at the graphics department at the NY Times. Open source.

- **Pattern** (MVC? V-only? etc.)
  MVC, but with the caveat the "View" class can be thought of as a controller.

- **Dependencies** (other libraries this tool depends on)
  Underscore.js is the only hard dependency.
  jQuery

- **Library or Framework?**
  Backbone is a library, not a framework, and plays well with others. You can embed Backbone widgets in Dojo apps without trouble, or use Backbone models as the data backing for D3 visualizations (to pick two entirely random examples).

- **Minified filesize** (NOT g-zipped! Download the minified script and ⌘I it)
    18kb

- **Browser Support** (if available)
  Most if not all, dependent on jQuery. IE6+
