## Intro to Local Storage

As we do dive into building more client-side applications, we're going to start thinking about how and where we store and manage our data. In doing so, we'll make use of browsers' local storage, introduced in HTML5. Take the next 15 minutes to research local storage, answering the questions below.

- What is local storage?
  - Answer: local storage consists of "per origin" data stored in the web browser, which persists even after the browser is closed.

- What problem does it solve?
  - Answer: a common application is to use client storage for simple applications without user registration, this eliminates the need for developers to maintain a database on the server.

- What are the alternatives?
  - Answer: session storage is a common alternative, however session storage is per-page-window, and does not persist after the browser is closed.

- Come up with a scenario in which local storage would be useful.
    - Scenario: user preferences or settings for a particular web application need to be saved and will not present a security risk.

- Think of a scenario where server-side storage would be preferred.
    - Scenario: when large amounts of data need to be persisted, local storage capacity is more limited.

- Come up with three scenarios in which local storage would be useful.
    - Example 1:
    - Example 2:
    - Example 3:
