## Regular Expressions

Regular Expressions are an incredibly powerful tool in the programmer's arsenal, but they look weird and for that reason beginners tend to shy away from them. Don't shy away! As a highly-capable individual, the only thing you have to fear regarding Regular Expressions is fear itself. Therefore, research.

####Directions

Take 15-20 minutes to research Regular Expressions and answer the questions below.

####Questions to Answer:

- What are Regular Expressions used for?
  - Articulation: Pattern-matching in a quick and powerful -- if not altogether intuitive -- way.

- What's the alternative to using regular expressions?
  - Answer: A bunch of clunky if statements or other tests in sequence to find the particular pattern that you're looking for.

- Are regular expressions unique to a particular language?
  - Answer: The particular library to use to implement them may be different, but the regular expression itself is a pretty standard string.

Once finished, head over to [Rubular.com](http://rubular.com) and look over the RegExp key. The key will be confusing at first, but it's actually remarkably sensible and accessible to anyone who sticks with it. Then start playing around with the test string "https://chase.com/derek.vander.hoop".
