a##Project 1 One-on-Ones

Each of the next three class days, you will have the opportunity to pair with one of the instructors. These pairing sessions will last 30 minutes, and will be focused on a specific User Story. If you don't have any User Stories written nor wireframes to work from, __we will not help you code.__ Process takes precedence.

####Today's Schedule
Today we are going to float and review your User Stories, ERD, and API validations to ensure that you aren't taking on too much for a 5 day sprint. Volunteer for today's session via HipChat.
