##Wireframing Tunr

####Objective:
You and a partner are going to spend 20 minutes developing wireframes for a Tunr signup page and user dashboard. The sole purpose of the signup page should be to convert visitors into users Tunr, while the purpose of a user dashboard is to present users with information and options deemed most relevant to the application. 

####Signup Page

- How can you briefly sell your visitors on Tunr's benefits?
- Knowing what you know about the User, identify what is absolutely necessary to the signup form.
- Conversely, given that the sole purpose of the signup page is to get people to signup for Tunr, what is extraneous to the signup page? (ie: Are you adding thing it doesn't need?)

####User Dashboard
Upon successful signup, the user should be taken to a dashboard page. Given Tunr's initial behavioral specifications outlined yesterday, discuss with your partner how best to layout the dashboard. What needs to be included? What is the heirarchy of the information presented? (ie: What deserves focus?)
