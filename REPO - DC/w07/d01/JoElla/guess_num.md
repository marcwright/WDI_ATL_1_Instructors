# Guess the number

- Create a basic "guess my number" game.  The computer will pick a random number between 0 and 10 inclusive.  The user will guess the number until they guess correctly.

###Specification:
- The user should be asked to guess a number
- If the user's guess is correct, the user should see a congratulatory message
- If the user's guess is not correct, the user should be asked to guess the number again.

###Bonus 1
- When the user guesses, you should tell them if they guessed too high or too low

###Bonus 2
- When the user guesses the number correctly, tell them how many guesses it took them.
