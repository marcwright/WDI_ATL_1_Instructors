## JavaScript Review Topics

Tonight we'll review the concepts below in the Gates Room of 1776. The review is focused on top level programming concepts in JavaScript, as we're going to be diving into more of the mechanics going forward. If you can't make the review session, make sure you review these concepts on your own using MDN and StackOverflow.
