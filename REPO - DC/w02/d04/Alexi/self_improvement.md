## Self-Improvement Homework

#####Step 1:
~~Review your self-assessment from last week. If you haven't filled it out yet, do so. This is mandatory.~~

#####Step 2:
~~Target 10 concepts or mechanics you feel unsure of, and write them into the numbered list below.~~

#####Step 3:
Research all of the items you listed, and write in either an explanation (if the item is a concept), or the necessary code snippet (if the item is a mechanical question).


1. What is a **reference** and how does it relate to variable assignment?
	- A reference is the variable

2. Describe the two forms of variable assignment used by programming languages
	- Instance Variable
	- Class variable
	- Local variable

3. Compare if/else statements to case statments and explain when you would use each
	- **Case statement**: Can work with objects

	- If/Else statement:

4. Compare while loops to enumeration and explain when you would use each
	- **Loops**: repeat behavior or conditional behavior 
	- **Enumeration**: is geared towards evaluating organized dataset

5. Create, access items in, change the value of items in, and manipulate items in nested collections (arrays & hashes)
	- Reviewing potter hwmk

6. Explain the difference between a **class** and an **instance**
	- **Objects**: possess state and behavior
	- **Class**: the blue-print, cad-drawing of an object
	- **Instance**: manifistation of a class/object

7. Identify when and how to use the enumerator methods `.each`, `.map`, `.join`, `.select`, `.reduce`
	- **`.each`**: execute the block of code for each element, then returns the list itself
	- **`.map`**: produces a new array containing the results of the block applied to each element of the receiver
	- **`.join`**: Returns a string created by converting each element of the array to a string, separated by the given separator
			- [ "a", "b", "c" ].join        #=> "abc"
			- [ "a", "b", "c" ].join("-")   #=> "a-b-c"
		
	- **`.select`**: Returns an array containing all elements of enum for which the given block returns a true value.
			- [1,2,3,4,5].select { |num|  num.even?  }   #=> [2, 4]
	- **`.reduce`**

8. Explain the difference between `.each` and `.map` and when you would use each one
	- .each will return the same information, .map will return a array with updated data.

9. Explain what **yield** does in the context of a block
	- Yield forces a method to take a block for its argument

10. Compare and contrast **blocks** and **methods**
	- A block is a set of instructions grouped together so that they can be passed around throughout a program
