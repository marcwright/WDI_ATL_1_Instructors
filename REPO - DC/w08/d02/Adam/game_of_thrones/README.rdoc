Create a new Rails app (use -T -d postgresql)

One model: Character
  - name, string, not null
  - dead, boolean, default to false

Create the AR Model

Test the Model in the Rails Console to make sure it works

Seed the database with ~3 characters

Create a route for the root which goes to characters index

Create a controller and view so that we can see all the characters on the index page in a ul (each character name should be in an li)
