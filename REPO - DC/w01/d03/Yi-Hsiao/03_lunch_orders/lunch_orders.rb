# ## Lunch Orders

# It's approaching lunch hourâ€¦ let's collect orders. Create a new file called `lunch_orders.rb` to complete this exercise.

# 1. Create a program that collects lunch orders. Prompt:
# 	* **Name for order:** (enter name)
# 	* **{name} wants to order:** (enter item)
# 2. Store the name/order data. When storing data, do it in such a way that additional order items may be added for the person's name.
# 	* Example: **Greg** can order a *Burger*, and then add *Fries* to his order later.
# 3. After storing data, prompt the user with:
# 	* **Add another item to the order? (y/n)**
# 	* Repeat steps 1 & 2 if the answer is "y"
# 3. After the user completes adding orders, print out:
# 	* **"All orders: {order data}"**

# ### Keep going...

# Rather than printing out a blob of raw lunch order data, print each name's orders on a separate line, formatted as one of the following:

# * "Greg ordered a sandwich"
# * "Peter ordered a burger & fries"
# * "Travis ordered a salad, guac & water"

# *You may have to do some hunting in Ruby docs!*
