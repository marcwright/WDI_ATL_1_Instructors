## Name Input

Collect a list of student names… the only catch is, we don't know how many we'll have! Create a file called `name_input.rb` and do the following:

* Write a program that prompts:
	* **"{n} so far. Enter a student name, or type 'done'"**
* Collect all names into an array.
* When *"done"* is entered, break the loop and print:
	* **"You collected {n} student names."**
	* **"The names are: {name1, name2, name3, …}"**
