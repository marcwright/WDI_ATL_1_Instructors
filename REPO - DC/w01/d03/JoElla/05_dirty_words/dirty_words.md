## Dirty Words

Here's an interesting challenge: test a phrase against an array of dirty words to see if it raises any red-flags. Use `dirty_words.rb` as a starting point for this exercise.

1. Prompt the user with **"Go ahead, say your worst:"**, and then accept an input sentance from them.
2. Convert their sentance to an array of words.
3. Check if any of their words are flagged as dirty words.
4. Print one of the following outcomes:
	* **"We're rejecting that, you potty mouth."**
	* **"Okay, we'll publish that."**

## Nowâ€¦

Do it without nesting any enumerable blocks inside one another.
