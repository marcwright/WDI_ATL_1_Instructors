# Directions: You're all adults with 20+ years of experience as learners,
# and you know your learning patterns best. Please answer these two simple questions,
# keeping your entire learning history in mind.

# 1) What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you during WDI?

# Not getting help when I could have used it. Getting discouraged in the process.

# Also resorting to copy and pasting code instead of trying to understand it.


# 2) How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?

# Understand that Greg, Peter and Travis are there to answer any questions, no matter how stupid they might seem.
# Making a better effort to understand what code is doing and plan out some "pseudo-code" before writing it.
