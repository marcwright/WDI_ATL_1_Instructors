# 1) What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you during WDI?
"My tendency to wait until the last minute. It's easier for me to think efficiently and harness focus when I'm under pressure."





# 2) How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?
"I can set up time designated to doing the homework immediately after class each day, so that I get started immediately and unlearn my habit of procrastination."
