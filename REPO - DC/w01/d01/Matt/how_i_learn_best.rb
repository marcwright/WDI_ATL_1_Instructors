# Directions: You're all adults with 20+ years of experience as learners,
# and you know your learning patterns best. Please answer these two simple questions,
# keeping your entire learning history in mind.

# 1) What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you during WDI?

# The first couple years of college it was easy to get away with bad habits; not attending class, waiting until the last minute to buy books, and just stay under the radar while still getting by.




# 2) How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?

# I turned my habits around towards the end of college. I feel I significantly improved upon these bad habits once I started working.
# Looking back, it was much easier to do well - and much more satisfying - by applying simple steps to stay engaged and on top of the material.
# To succeed at GA, I know to apply the good learning habits I figured out during college while continuing the passion I have developed for webdev over the past few years.
