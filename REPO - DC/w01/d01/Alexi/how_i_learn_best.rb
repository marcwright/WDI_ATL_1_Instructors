# Directions: You're all adults with 20+ years of experience as learners,
# and you know your learning patterns best. Please answer these two simple questions,
# keeping your entire learning history in mind.

# 1) What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you during WDI?
<<<<<<< HEAD
=begin

I have not been a full-time student for many years. I'm used to coming home and relaxing 
after work. I need to re-learn how to be productive in the evening and on the weekends.

=end


# 2) How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?
=begin
I need to set aside explicit time to regroup after class, but then study too. I also need to
set aside time on the weekends.
