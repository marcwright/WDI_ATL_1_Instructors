# Directions: You're all adults with 20+ years of experience as learners,
# and you know your learning patterns best. Please answer these two simple questions,
# keeping your entire learning history in mind.

# 1) What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you during WDI?
#My first bad habit is that I procrastinate.
#The other bad habit is that in the past I have done my work in such a way that I achieve a high GPA,
#while not necessarily retaining anything or actually learning the subject matter.




# 2) How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?
#It sounds trite, but the only way I can think to not let these habits affect my experience at
#General Assembly is to simply not do these things.  I think the structure of the program, as
#well as my overwhelming fear of failure, will serve to keep me from procrastinating, just out of
#pure necessity.  Also, I'm not as comfortable with this subject matter as I have been with
#other subjects in the past, so I can't just put off the work; I have to actually sit down and
#digest it, as well as take time to address my weak spots.
