# Directions: You're all adults with 20+ years of experience as learners,
# and you know your learning patterns best. Please answer these two simple questions,
# keeping your entire learning history in mind.

# 1) What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you during WDI?

# A bad habit of mine is procrastinating on assignments and studying. I'm also used
# to being spoon-fed the answers, instead of proactively seeking them out myself.
# In addition, I sometimes spend too much time on the unimportant details, such as
# formatting, and then rush through the important information as time runs out.


# 2) How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?

# I plan on setting aside time every day to work on my homework and review material.
# If time permits, I will try to review topics ahead of the lessons. I will also try
# to solve problems on my own first, and then utilize the office hours if I need
# additional help.
