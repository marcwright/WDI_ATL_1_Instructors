# Directions: You're all adults with 20+ years of experience as learners,
# and you know your learning patterns best. Please answer these two simple questions,
# keeping your entire learning history in mind.

# 1) What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you during WDI?
# I tend to dwell on solving details rather than moving on to solve the bigger picture and finding the "detail" answer along the way.
# I'm also a visual learner so I will try to take as many pictures and creat "visual maps"

# 2) How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?
# I just mentioned how I will try and combat the "visual learner"
# As for the "dwelling on the details," I will try to make sure that I read assigments for the day before the day starts.
