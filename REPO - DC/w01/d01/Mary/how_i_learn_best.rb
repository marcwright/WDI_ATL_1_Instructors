# Directions: You're all adults with 20+ years of experience as learners,
# and you know your learning patterns best. Please answer these two simple questions,
# keeping your entire learning history in mind.

# 1) What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you during WDI?
# I definitely developed a bad habit in college of procrastinating when I felt comfortable with
# the work or had a plan for completing it. I will also need to work hard to not let myself
# become overwhelmed when I feel like I'm in over my head with this course, which I'm sure will
# be often.


# 2) How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?
# I've definitley improved in regards to procrastinating; I've gotten better about self-discipline,
# and it definitely helps that this is unfamiliar material that I know that I need to really
# devote myself to learning and absorbing. In terms of not getting overwhelmed, deep breaths and
# taking breaks definitely helps. I'm going to try to spend a substantial part of each evening
# going over the material that day so that I feel more comfortable with it and won't feel behind
# during class.
