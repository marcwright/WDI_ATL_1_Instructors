# Directions: You're all adults with 20+ years of experience as learners,
# and you know your learning patterns best. Please answer these two simple questions,
# keeping your entire learning history in mind.

# 1) What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you during WDI?

I do not always push ahead to ask questions in group settings.

I tend to try and keep working at my same pace, even as I am being left behind.

I dont always feel comfortable joking around until I have come to know someone well.




# 2) How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?

I must realize that asking the question will help the entire group succeed.

I must realize that simply stopping work and listening to what is happening is a fine way to learn, when one is being left behind.

Joking isn't always important?
