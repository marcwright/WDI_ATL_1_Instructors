## Peter Lai Shops On...

####Prompt:
Peter Lai continues to shop. Your task is to make the appropriate updates to his receipts table:

1. Yesterday, he purchased 3 Batman shirts (at $20.00 a pop) from Target.

2. Peter returned 'The Last Tycoon' to the local bookstore, and the store kindly refunded his card, so the purchase price should be updated to $0.00.

3. Add a 'returned' column onto the receipts table. It should take a boolean value and default to `false`.
  - Update the 'returned' value for 'The Last Tycoon' to true.

4. Looks like Peter mis-typed JC Penney while inputting his receipts (he forgot the second 'E'). Make sure the store's spelling is correct for all relevant entries in the receipts table.

5. Technically, the __R__ in __Toys R Us__ should be surrounded by double quotes. Update all relevant entries with the proper spelling of Toys "R" Us.

6. Peter is embarrassed about his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles bedspread and wants the purchase stricken from the receipts table. Indulge him.
