#ENERGY MANAGEMET

#A) What's working?
  # Staying late and working with individuals who seem to be in a similar situation, developmentally, is certainly working.  This enables me to issue and receive both assistance and feedback.  The one on one time I can garner from office hours helps to fill-in any conceptual gaps my brain may have induced while operating at maximum capacity throughout the day.

  # My weekends are spent going over the homework solutions, re-visiting the pre-work, and researching various Ruby concepts upon which I'd like to build.  Just last night I dove in to regular expressions and realized there is an entire world of Ruby logic out there that I'd like to know more about.

#B) What isn't working:
  # While helpful, staying until 9 or 10 every evening is also quite draining.  I have at least an hour commute before I find myself walking through the front door.  I need to work more efficiently.

  # Additionally, I don't usually internalize new concepts the first time aorund.  I realize that I'll need to re-teach to myself much of what we learn in the classroom, and end up feeling one-step behind.

  # And of course, comparing myself to others and stressing about whether or not I'll be marketable at the end of this course is a constant battle.
