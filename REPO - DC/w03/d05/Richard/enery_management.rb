Over the last three weeks Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work individually, in teams of ast little as two ,as well as collaborate with groups of classmates of the WDI course.  From these experiences, the importance of teamwork and collaboration has shown much more brightly than any other methods.  I can humbly say I do not know everything, but I do know that each one of my classmates have their strong suits and week.  Combining our mindpower helps to solidify our foundation of the concepts we've learned thus far.

 That being said, the best practices that I've developed over the last three weeks stem from the after class collaborate homework sessions. While upstairs we're able to work on a number of challenging assignments, and when I'm able to help teach those around me, it also helps me understand concepts better. As far as in-class work, I find myself able to understand new/foreign concepts when I can ask a barrage of questions, even when those questions are somewhat obvious to many. Additionally for in-class and out of class work, the importance of modeling can't be stressed enough.  Visually mapping out a problem to see a path is invaluable.

What has not worked for me is being overly confident in my abilities and end up procrastinating. This leads to me circling back to perform tasks I beleived I was adequately equipped to complete, and end up hitting roadblocks.
