# WHAT'S WORKING: Maybe it's just because I started off the first couple
# of weeks with the additional energy demands of wrapping up law school
# on top of the demands of this course, but at this point I'm feeling really
# good.  I've been getting enough sleep and waking up and swimming for an
# hour most days of the week, which have always been my two defense
# mechanisms against getting overwhelmed by work life.  I also started
# actually observing Sundays as the day of rest a couple of months ago and
# have started to feel the spiritual and psychological benefits of that as
# well.  I've been taking a night or two during the week to get out and
# catch up with friends & family, which seems like a good amount of time.
# The content of the course has been fairly intuitive thusfar, so I haven't
# hit that wall of frustration at all yet.

# WHAT COULD BE BETTER: I'm going to make an effort to seek out students/the
# instructors more to ask 1-on-1 questions.  I'm curious about stuff that's
# sometimes too obscure to benefit the class as a whole.  To this point, I've
# mostly just sought out answers online, but the rest of the way I'm going
# to make more of an effort to talk with other folks in the class about
# questions as they come up.  Also, I do enjoy being able to go home at the
# end of the day and work alone on problems for a couple of hours, but I
# also want to strike a balance so that it never feels like I'm running out
# of here at the end of formal class time.  Starting next week, I think I'll
# start hanging around here until 6 PM or so and then walking home after
# that -- but really, the spirit of the thing is more important than having
# a concrete deadline.
