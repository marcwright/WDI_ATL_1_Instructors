#How I spent my time learning this week.

#What has worked for me?
#   This week I actually ended up missing two homework assignemnts because first off, I tried to add some things into my life
#that ended up not working. I thought I could manage the homework and also do some other things but it looks like
#it may be just a bit too much to handle. I think that between commuting an hour home back and forth and the hours
#spent in the class, and the hour spent on homework, I have to manage what I try to do. Also I find it so very
#important to decompress after an 8 hour class. I often find it very hard to do homework right after I finish
# in class because it is just way too much at once. I like to go home and eat and relax a little before i dive in
#again. That has worked for me.

#I honestly think that I could probably do more bonuses as well. I have been skimping on those because my brain
#and my body both reject doing so much learning in a single day, but since I'm young and supple I could
#probably still handle it. I think the most important part is that I always keep up with the homework,
#beacuse in the end that is what helps me and I get to develop a deeper understanding, as well as feel like
#I have done something with the things I learned in class. Skipping homework actually feels really horrible.
