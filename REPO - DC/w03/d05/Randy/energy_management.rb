# So far I have found one of the most useful things for me has been participating in after
# class homework sessions with others students. This provides a great way to bounce ideas and hear
# perspectives that can unlock some an understanding that I was missing. Additionally, having the
# ability to get help with specific issues from the instructor upstairs is useful for me
# in getting answers to specific questions without holding up class.

# One thing that has slowed me down has been not getting enough sleep. I often get home, need to
# spend a little more time on my HW, eat dinner, etc. I have found myself sacrificing sleep in
# order to gain a an hour or two of just screwing around time. I know I need some time to not think
# about code, but I have to find a sustainable balance. Sleep is my key I think, when I get enough
# the night before concepts and practices make more sense and are easier to learn.

# So overall, I think continuing to spend time with my peers after class will provide a great
# benefit to me in absorbing the concepts I learned that day. Getting enough sleep to be able
# to learn, and being disciplined enough to go to bed are the areas I need improvement to
# be ultimately successful in this course.


# Also coffee.


    #And beer too.
