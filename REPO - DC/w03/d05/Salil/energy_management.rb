A) What's working -
  Staying after class and doing homework upstairs as opposed to going home to work on it. Much more motivating to do so when the environment is solely about finishing the homework. I don't plan on changing that.

B)What's not working -
  I do feel tired at times during lecture when I'm not actively engaged in something. I find standing up and moving around a bit mitigates that but there are times where I'm a little self-conscious about doing so, especially when I sit in the front and worry about blocking other people's views. Trying to find a way to balance those two.
