A) What's working
  Asking questions during class and volunterring answers. Stay vocal going forward.

  Staying focused on the high level concepts and allowing the low-level syntax to come with reps. Realize that it may take a couple of days for something to sink in.

  Staying balanced overall with sleep and social life as much as possible. Maximize by planning ahead and setting aside fixed time to work on coding.

B) What isn't working
  Been lost at times during the HW. Need to get out of the habit of cowboy coding and plan more before diving in.
  Could better utilize office hours as well.

  Not knowing what tool is best for a given situation. Can minimize by going out and utiliing some external resources to gain more code/accepted methods exposure with sites such as codewars.com

  Momentary lapses of focus during class. Closing stuff like Twitter and saving it for breaks can minimize this.
