# Class is going well...classwork hasn't been a huge challenge for me so far, but the more abstract lessons are difficult (for example, Greg's yesterday about the different layers of the internet). I feel like I'm at a bit of a disadvantage once we start talking about hardware and the internet, since I don't have as strong of a traditional "tech" background; a lot of those terms and concepts were completely foreign to me yesterday and felt overwhelming. I've definitely been making an effort to maintain a semblance of social life, because I realized quickly that my morale suffers on those days that I don't give my brain a break and get outside of the classwork.
# One thing I recognize that I need to work on is pushing myself. Julia Lovett made a great point about how she wishes she had allowed herself to fail more, and that is something that I have definitely shied away from. My typical pattern is to quickly get a program working and then stop because I "finished" the assignment; I need to make more of an effort to keep going and making it better, even if it means not necessarily being able to and "failing".
