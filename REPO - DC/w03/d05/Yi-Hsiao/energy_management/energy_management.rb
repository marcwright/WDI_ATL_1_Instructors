# WHAT ISN'T WORKING

# I have programmed for several years.  So for the first few weeks, I have been coasting through the classes and assignments.  This has led to a bit of overconfidence, because I presume to know the material already.

# However, I cannot be overconfident. There is so much to learn and understand in technology and I should go seek this knowledge out on my own and find new things to learn while finishing up my assignments.
