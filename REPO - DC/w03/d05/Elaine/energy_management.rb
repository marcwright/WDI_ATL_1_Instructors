Energy Management

What's working for me is writing down the commands and methods that we go over in  class. That way, on the homework and later assignments, I have the correct syntax to refer back to. I also attempt all of the homework assignments, which has been a great learning experience. I hope to stay after class more often to work on the homework, because those sessions and collaborating with everyone have been very helpful.

What's not working for me as well is not applying the new concepts we learned to my latest assignments, but instead often turning to the older, less efficient, but familiar methods. Other than working on the homework, I typically don't spend any time outside of class reviewing topics. I hope to have better time management so that I can set time aside to review. I'm also getting to class on average a few minutes late each day. I hope to manage my time better so that I can get more sleep and be in class on time.
