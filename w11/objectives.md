# Single-Page Apps

## Concepts
- Explain why routes should manage application view state, rather than having views manage each other.
- Explain the benefit of having granular view components, each with simple jobs to do.
- Explain why all business logic should reside in the model, while the view simply expresses its state.

# Modular Design

## Concepts
- Explain what a "module" is.
- Explain what Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) is, and what problems it solves.
- Describe what RequireJS is, and (basically) what it does.
- Describe what "dependency injection" refers to.
- Describe what an application's "main" module does.

## Mechanics
- Wrap your components in module wrappers that each declare their own dependencies.
- Require your application components among one another.
- Setup a RequireJS environment within your own project.
