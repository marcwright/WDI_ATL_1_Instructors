# Lab HTML

* Get the students to create a page that they can publish on their github profile. This page has to include:
  * Differents heading tags semantically used like :
    * Name 
    * Residence Details
    * 2 or 3 pictures (can be in a table)
    * unordered list for education
    * table for past experiences
    * favorite hobbies in ordered list
    * social links with logos
    * Bonus : Favorite youtube Video


* give the students a wrong-formatted html page (mostly divs) and get them to update the markup to be valid (and even maybe semantic !)
