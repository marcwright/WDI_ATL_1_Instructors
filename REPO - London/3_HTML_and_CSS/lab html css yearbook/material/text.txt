The Program
12 weeks of intensive web development training learning a range of programming techniques and languages.

The Students
The London WDI Session 3 Coding Collective

We faced missing routes, broken links, aborted rake tasks, rejected mass-assignments, failed deployments, nilClasses, illegal nestings, conflicted merges, rougue debuggers, unexpected keyword ends, incomplete divs, unintentional infinite loops, uncooperative asset pipelines, empty migrations, unresponsive APIs, undefined defined methods, overly-sassy css, dirty data, faulty gems, terrible animated gifs, excessive pizza, punchy classmates, demanding instructors and long days. And we won!

Ruby On rails
Web development that doesn't hurt


Ruby on Rails, often simply Rails, is an open source web application framework which runs via the Ruby programming language. It is a full-stack framework: it allows creating pages and applications that gather information from the web server, talk to or query the database, and render templates out of the box. As a result, Rails features a routing system that is independent of the web server.

Ruby on Rails emphasizes the use of well-known software engineering patterns and principles, such as active record pattern,convention over configuration (CoC) ,don't repeat yourself (DRY) , and model–view–controller (MVC) .

The Instructors
They taught us everything we know

Well, let's be honest. They taught us a lot more than we know, but some of it didn't commit to memory. But we are hackers now, thanks to these four.
