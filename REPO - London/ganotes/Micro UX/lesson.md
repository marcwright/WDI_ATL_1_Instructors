# Micro UX 

- Yesterday we did some kind of analytical big-picture thinking. 
  - What does our site do? What's it for? 
    - Are we selling something? 
    - Are we helping people explore new things?
    - Are we a reference? 
  - What do we want our user to do? 
  - How do we communicate that stuff? 
  - What makes things feel professional and polished? 

- Today we're going to look at some small details.
- But before we do, we've got to think about design. What is design? 
  - Design is not how it looks. 
  - Design is how it works. 
  - Design is how it fits in people's lives. 
  - Design is how people interact with something. 
  - And there's a visual layer. 

- So really, design (and UX) is all about people. And people suck! 
  - People make typos
  - People make other mistakes
  - People try things that will never work
  - People meddle
  - People forget things
  - People misunderstand things
  - People don't read

  - There's a "Please wait" screen... that's been made to include useful information.

  - Is this an easy way to display information for a programmer? 
  - Is it useful to the user? 
  - There's two things going on: more useful to the user, and breaking the paradigm. 
    - Calendars don't have to be a grid on a screen.
    - Calculators don't have to look like a grid of numbers.
