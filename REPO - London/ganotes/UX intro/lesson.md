UX intro
========

- So, we've talked a lot about technical stuff. Some deeply technical stuff in some cases. 
- But there's another area of development that we've kind of neglected. 
  - The human factor. 
- But in a way it's the same: all the way along we've been trying to make you think analytically. 
  - Now it's about people, not computers. 


So let's have a look at a site. 

## Case study 1: Pinboard
- https://pinboard.in/
- What is it? 
- What does it want you to do? 
- What's the most important thing on this page? 
- Do you understand what it does? 
- Does it make you want to sign up? 
- Where are you most likely to click?

- It's not very pretty. 
- It's the kind of service where you kinda have to know that you want it before you arrive. 
- It's quite text-heavy. 

Let's compare it to Delicious: 
- https://delicious.com/
- Much clearer in terms of what it does
- Much heavier in pushing you for signup. 
- What if you want more info? 


## Case study 2: Hype Machine
- http://hypem.com/
- What is it? 
- What does it want you to do? 
- How is it different to Pinboard? 
  - Goals: sign up vs. give someone something interesting
  - More 'browsey', less 'salesy'. 
- What's the most important thing on this page? 
  - Is there a most important thing?
- How are they drawing attention to/from things? 
  - Text size
  - Position
  - Shading
  - Spacing

Let's compare it to Digg: 
- http://digg.com/
- How is it different? 
  - Goal
  - No exposition
- How is it the same? 
  - Help people discover interesting stuff
- What's the design like? 
  - Simple
  - Minimalist
  - Bad? 
  - How does it compare to Pinboard? 
- How do you discover new features? Power user features? 
  - Hover
  - Let people interact with things and ask them to sign up once they try to

## So what are some key takeaways? 
- Design matters
- People don't read, they just scan and click. 
- Balance your goals with your audience's goals
- Help people along, think about how the site fits together holistically.
- Think about what's important, and make it more prominent. 
- Remember that different people want different things; you have to find a balance.
  - Different users want different things
  - Different people in your company want different things.
