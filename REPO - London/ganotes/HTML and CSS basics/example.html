            <h2><a name="philosophy"></a>Programming Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Programmers work with <em>ideas</em> first, <em>languages</em> second. You are not a <em>ruby programmer</em>; you are a <em>programmer who uses ruby</em>. When someone asks you to build something, a key part of your job is to say &quot;What problem are you trying to solve?&quot; instead of &quot;Yes, I shall build it right away.&quot;. You exist to solve problems, problems that your boss may not understand, and his solution might not be the best one. He may ask you to set his pillows on fire; you should ask him why &amp; offer a hot water bottle instead of reaching straight for the matches.</p>
            <p>You are striving for a balance of pragmatism and elegance. You should not tune your work for no good reason, but nor should you neglect its quality. Corners must sometimes be cut; corner-cutting must not ever be habitual.</p>
            <p>The web has a long history, and it should be respected. We strive to build sites usable by everybody; do not tie your work to a particular browser or operating system. Remember that not everybody has JavaScript. Remember that not everyone has a Mac. Remember that not everyone has a smart phone.</p>
