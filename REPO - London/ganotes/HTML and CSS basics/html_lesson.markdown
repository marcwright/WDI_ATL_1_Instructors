# HTML Basics

Objective: 
- Students can create basic HTML pages
- Students understand how what they enter in HTML gets displayed on screen
- Students have a basic understanding of the DOM
- Students can differentiate tags from attributes
- Students can differentiate bodyless tags from body tags


Framing: 
- We're starting at the front, with what the user sees
- We're starting with something that should be familiar to you
- We're starting with something you can use to make web pages of your own


Outline: 
- What does HTML stand for? 
- What does that mean? 
  - It's not a programming language, it's a markup language
  - It gives structure to a text document
  - Other programs, like a web browser, can interpret that structure

- Setting up your workspace
  - Create a directory for the files
  - Create an empty file
  - Open it in the browser

- The basic skeleton
  - Add a doctype
  - Add an <html> tag, explain what this means
  - Add the head and body tags, explain what they are
  - Add a title in the head section, and add a headline to the body
  - Hit refresh, see it

- Checking your work
  - Run it through the W3C validator
  - It won't validate, so let's fix it and explain what they mean

- Add some more content
