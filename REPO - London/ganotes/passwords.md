# How you are supposed to store your passwords. 

- Why do we care? 
  - Bad things happen when people get our passwords.
    - Order things from your Amazon account. 
    - Spam your friends on Facebook
    - Steal your naked pictures. 
    - Read your diary. 
    - Delete all your stuff. 
    - Bank transfers
    - Defame you. 
    - Steal your company's source code. 
    - Read your company's secrets. 
  - Who's trying to get your passwords? 
    - Disgruntled exes. 
    - Sociopathic "friends"
    - Your company's competitors
    - Criminals
    - Bored teenagers
    - Bored call centre workers
    - Programs. 
  - And your email account is basically the keys to the kingdom. 
    - Because every other account has a 'reset password?' option that will email you a reset link. 

- So how do people get your passwords? 
  - Guesswork.

  - "Dictionary" attacks. 
    - Real words
    - Words taken from lists like this
    - Proper nouns
    - Modifications
  - Keyloggers
    - Ever logged in from an internet café? Do you trust them? 
    - Viruses can wait for you to type your password, and save it/send it off to others on the internet. 
  - Stolen databases/compromised services
    - LinkedIn: 6.5 million accounts http://mashable.com/2012/06/06/linkedin-passwords-hacked-confirmation/
    - Evernote: 50 million accounts http://thinkprogress.org/security/2013/12/31/3108661/10-biggest-privacy-security-breaches-rocked-2013/
    - Adobe: 150 million accounts http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/adobe-breach-inadvertently-tied-to-other-accounts/
  
- So once someone has your password, they can try it other places. 
  - Once someone has your Adobe account, what happens if they try to login with that username and password to: 
    - Gmail
    - Amazon
    - deviantART
    - Photobucket
    - eBay
    - PayPal
    - Match.com

- You can change your password everywhere if someone gets it...
  - ... if you hear about it. Do you trust every website everywhere to get in touch with you if they get hacked? 
  - ... if you can remember where you've used it. Hint: you won't remember everywhere. 
  - ... if you get there in time. 

- So what makes a password strong? 
  - Length
  - Randomness
  - Possibilities. 
  
  - Look at some possibilities of passwords, and talk through the maths. 

- So... how do you protect yourself? 
  - Using a different password for every service. 
    - Make it something crazy hard 
    - Don't try to remember it yourself, use something that remembers them for you.

  - 2 factor authentication
    - Passwords are 1 factor authentication. 
    - What if a site asked you for two passwords? 
      - Still 1 factor! 
    - The 'factor' is 'something you know'. 
    - The second factor is generally 'something you have'. 
    - When you go to the ATM, you're using 2 factor authentication. 
      - You must have your debit card AND you must enter your PIN
    - If you've ever logged in to a company VPN, you might have got a token that shows a temporary code you must enter 
    - Some services let you use something similar on your phone.
      - Show phone. 
      - Explain why I'm cool with showing you this stuff. 
    - Github, Google, Dropbox. 
    - Now, whenever I try to login to these services, it'll ask me for the code as well as the password. 
  - Be selective where you type in your passwords. 
    - Do you trust your girlfriend's Windows laptop from 2005? 
    - That internet café? 
    - On an unsecured wifi network?
