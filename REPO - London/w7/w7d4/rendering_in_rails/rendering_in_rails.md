# Rendering | 11:00 - 12:00
- A few ways that controllers can control what the view does (or doesn't do)

  $ rails new rendering
  $ cd rendering
  $ rails g controller products index show special_show
  edit routes


  - By default, Rails will render the view that matches the action name, from the folder that matches the controller's name

  - To render nothing:
  render nothing: true

  - To render a specific action's view (so from a search action you could render):
  render 'list'
  render :list
  render action: :list
  # note: none of those run any of the referenced action's code... just its view file

  - To render a specific action's view in another controller:
  render 'products/show'

  - To render an arbitrary file (takes an explicit file-system path):
  render '/Users/michael/test_file'
  render file: '/Users/michael/test_file'

  - To render specific text:
  render text: "OK"

  - To render JSON or XML (Rails will expect the object you pass in to have a ".to_json" or ".to_xml" method):
  render json: @product
  render xml: @product

  - To override the default layout:
    render layout: 'alternative_layout' # expects there to be an 'alternative_layout.html.erb' file in the views/layouts/ directory
    render layout: false

    There are also ways to specify the layout per controller, and even by each request.


  - DoubleRenderError
    - You will see this error from time to time. Here is some code that would cause it:

      def show
        @book = Book.find(params[:id])
        if @book.special?
          render :action => "special_show"
        end
        render :action => "regular_show"
      end

      The convention is to add "and return"
        render :action => "special_show" and return


  - Redirecting rather than rendering.
    - Redirecting tells the browser to make a new request for the redirected path.
      Note: You can only redirect to GET paths... this is a bit of an obsticle sometimes
      Also, the redirect requires a round-trip to the browser, so can slow down response times.

    redirect_to photos_url
    redirect_to @product
    redirect_to 'http://google.co.uk'
