# Rails 3, Devise, Omniauth, and Google

 
Getting authentication through Google in a Rails application is a breeze with the right tools. To get a simple, no-frills authentication system up and running in a Rails 3 application, all you really need is Devise, Omniauth, and a Google API account.


- Step 1: Signing up for Google API access

  Before being able to wire up authentication in your rails app, you will need to set up a Google App. First, get your API key at:

    https://code.google.com/apis/console

  Create a project
  Click 'APIs & auth'
  Make sure "Contacts API" and "Google+ API" are on.
  Click on 'credentials' and provide details for your OAuth Client. For development purposes, the Home Page URL can be "localhost:3000"

  After all of the details have been set, you will then get access to the screen with all of the information you will for your Rails app. For now, locate the section that contains your Client ID and Client Secret, you will need these later to configure your Rails application. Also make sure you have a redirect URI set to:

    http://localhost:3000/users/auth/google_oauth2/callback

  (unless you are using a different port or local server, in which case, use your computer's address)


- Step 2: Setting up your Rails app

  You will need to add the following to your app's gemfile:

    gem 'devise'
    gem 'omniauth-google-oauth2'

  bundle the new gems and then setup up devise from the command line:

    rails g devise:install
    rails g devise User

  Require authentication for the contacts controller

    # contacts_controller.rb
    before_filter :authenticate_user!

- Step 3: Configure the user model and Devise

  We will need to tweak the previous default Devise setup to get it to work with Google and OAuth. First, go into the user model and add the omniauthable package and attributes for :provider, and :uid (and any others you might want...)

    # add to migration
    t.string :provider
    t.string :uid

    # user.rb
    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable, :omniauthable,
             :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable, :validatable,
             omniauth_providers: [:google_oauth2]

      attr_accessible :email, :provider, :uid, :password, :remember_me
    end

    # config/initializers/devise.rb
    config.omniauth :google_oauth2, 'APP_ID', 'APP_SECRET'


    Where 'APP_ID' and 'APP_SECRET' are replaced with your app's actual keys from step 1.


- Step 4: Setting up the Routes and Callback Controller

  Now that Devise is set up and your app is configured to work with Google correctly, it is time to work on the routes and controllers for handling the callbacks from Google. First, create a new controller called omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb and make it look something like this:

    https://gist.github.com/Pavling/1e6cc6e464a34f28a733

    # omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb
    class OmniauthCallbacksController < Devise::OmniauthCallbacksController
      def google_oauth2
        user = User.from_omniauth(request.env["omniauth.auth"])
        if user.persisted?
          flash.notice = "Signed in Through Google!"
          sign_in_and_redirect user
        else
          session["devise.user_attributes"] = user.attributes
          flash.notice = "Problem creating account"
          redirect_to new_user_registration_url
        end
      end
    end


  As you can see from the above code, the OmniauthCallbacksController has only the one 'google_oauth2â€² method. This method instantiates a user from the information retrieved from the omniauth hash that came back from Google. It relies on the "from_omniauth" method that we will have to create on the User model in a moment, but for now it is important to understand that what this method does is, it checks for an existing user with the same credentials, if it finds one, it signs that user in, if it does not, then it redirects to Devise's new_user_registration_url to complete the registration process because this user does not yet exist.

  Next, adjusting the routes to handle this callback is as simple as adding the following to your routes file:

    devise_for :users, controllers: { omniauth_callbacks: "omniauth_callbacks" }


- Step 5: Finishing up the User Model

  We still need to handle the "from_omniauth" check necessary for the OmniauthCallbacksController in the User model.

    https://gist.github.com/Pavling/8d07fc68137b135f256f

    # user.rb 
    def self.from_omniauth(auth)
      if user = User.find_by_email(auth.info.email)
        user.provider = auth.provider
        user.uid = auth.uid
        user
      else
        where(auth.slice(:provider, :uid)).first_or_create do |user|
          user.provider = auth.provider
          user.uid = auth.uid
          user.email = auth.info.email
          user.password = Devise.friendly_token[0,20]
        end
      end
    end


  As you can see from the above code, I added one method to the user model to get all of the functionality working properly. The 'from_omniauth' method checks to see if a user exists based the on the information retrieved from the auth hash that Omniauth gives us. If a user already exits, the method returns the user and the controller then signs that user in.

  If that user does not yet exist, it creates a new user based on the information from Omniauth, and adds a default, random password to prevent errors from Devise.


- Step 6: Configuring the Views

  The final step in this process is to add the login, register, logout, and "sign in with Google" functionality. A basic solution to this is as simple as adding something like the following to your application layout file.

    https://gist.github.com/Pavling/f496218f0112caeaf0e5

    # application.html.erb
    <div class='login'>
      <% if current_user %>
        <%= current_user.email %>
        <%= link_to "Log out", destroy_user_session_path, method: :delete %>
      <% else %>
        <%= link_to "Sign In", new_user_session_path %>
        <%= link_to "Register", new_user_registration_path %>
        or
        <%= link_to "Sign in with Google", user_omniauth_authorize_path(:google_oauth2) %>
      <% end %>
    </div>
    <p class="notice"><%= notice%></p>
    <p class="alert"><%= alert%></p>


  You will have to restart your Rails app for all of the changes to take effect, but upon restart, you should now have a functioning Authentication system that lets users login either natively through your Rails app and Devise, or through Google.

  You should now see something like the following after firing up your local Rails Server:

  If a user clicks on "Sign in with Google", they will be redirected to to Google for authentication and upon success, redirected back to your application. Yay!


# Limitations and Considerations

  This app makes an assumption that would need to be overcome if your needs are different. Currently, this app would only work with either Devise or Google OAuth for authentication. If you would like other methods (like Facebook, Twitter, or Github) in addition to Google, you would need to write methods to handle the various callbacks from each of those respective services.
