# Sinatra | 9:45 - 10:30
- Sinatra is a light-weight Ruby web framework
  - It handles serving pages for requests, but leaves pretty much everything else to us
  - http://www.sinatrarb.com
  
  gem install sinatra sinatra-contrib
    (https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra-contrib # some common extensions to Sinatra we might find useful)

- example from Sinatra website:

    require 'sinatra'
    get '/hi' do
      "Hello World!"
    end

    ruby hi.rb

- expand a little in the time remaining:

  require 'pry'
  require 'sinatra'
  require 'sinatra/reloader' if development

  get '/hi' do
    "Hello World!"
    binding.pry
  end

  # how to have just a homepage
  get '/' do
    'this is the homepage'
  end
  
  # capture parameters from the path
  get '/name/:first' do
    "your name is : #{params[:first]}"
  end
  
  # this could keep on going
  get '/name/:first/:last/:age' do
    "your name is #{params[:first]} #{params[:last]} and you are #{params[:age]} years old"
  end
  
  # html injection?
  
  # multiply two numbers and show the result
  get '/multiply/:x/:y' do
    result = params[:x].to_f * params[:y].to_f
    "the result is #{result}"
  end
  # where have we seen this before?...

# break | 10:30 - 10:45

# Sinatra, Calc demo app | 10:45 - 12:00
- setup app

  mkdir views

- create a view, and use it

  touch views/calc.rb

  # remove the render code, and change to an instance var
  get '/multiply/:x/:y' do
    @result = params[:x].to_f * params[:y].to_f
    erb :calc
  end

  # views/calc.rb
  the result is <%= @result %>

- what is this "ERB"?
  Embedded RuBy
  
  <% "evaluates the Ruby contained in the brackets, but doesn't do anything *with* it _in the view_" %>

  <%= "evaluates the Ruby contained in the brackets, and "puts" it in the view" %>
  
  <%# be careful with Ruby comments %>
  <% "don't be tempted to half-comment an expression" # like this; as the parser can get confused %>
  <% "it's best" %><%# to add another ERB block imediately afterwards to contain only the comments %>

- layouts (templates)
  - our ERB file needs all the HTML structure, and CSS files included
  - but *all* of our ERB files will need that... so we wanna be DRY
  
  touch views/layout.rb
  
  #layout
  <!doctype html>
  <html lang='en'>
    <head>
      <meta charset='utf-8'>
      <title>Calculator</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <%= yield %>
    </body>
  </html>

- add CSS
  mkdir public
  touch public/style.css

  # layout
  <link rel='stylesheet' href='/style.css'>
  
  # CSS
  body {
    background-color: green;
  }

- Forms
  - Make the UI have form fields rather than editing the URL
  
  <form action='/calc' method='get'>
    <input type='text' name='first'>
    <input type='text' name='operator'>
    <input type='text' name='second'>
    <button>calculate!</button>
  </form>
  
  - Add a "/calc" handler
  
  get '/calc' do
    binding.pry
    erb :calc
  end
  # and interrogate params hash in pry
  
  get '/calc' do
    @first = params[:first].to_f
    @second = params[:second].to_f
    @operator = params[:operator]

    @result = case @operator
                when '+' then @first + @second
                when '-' then @first - @second
                when '*' then @first * @second
                when '/' then @first / @second
              end

    erb :calc
  end
  
  - update the view
  <% if @result %>
    <section>
      <header><h1>Result</h1></header>
      <div id='first'>the first number is <%= @first %></div>
      <div id='operator'>the operator is '<%= @operator %>'</div>
      <div id='second'>the second number is <%= @second %></div>
      <div id='result'><%= @result %></div>
    </section>
  <% end %>

# Lunch 	| 12:00 - 13:00

# Stock lab | 13:00 - 15:30
- Students should work individually on this assignment.

- Create a webpage.
- Add a header and footer.
- Add a field for symbol with a submit button.
- Then print out the stock symbol and the current price.
- Use the yahoofinance gem.
- You can include the normalize.css/reset.css files for your styling.

# break | 15:30 - 15:45

# Links Demo	 | 15:45 - 17:00
- The applications we have been writing are cool, but they are just one page. Letâ€™s create an application that has links to multiple pages.

  touch main.rb
  mkdir public
  mkdir views
  cd public
  touch public/style.css
  touch views/layout.erb

Copy the layout and main.rb frame from previous.

- It could be worth copying this boiler-plate directory, because lots of our Sinatra apps will start off the same way
