# Project work review  | 9:00 - 10:00

# scopes | 10:00 - 11:00
  - using the "joins_etc" app from Tuesday...

  # post.rb
  scope :published, where('published_at is not null')

  - and you can join them:
  scope :published, where('published_at is not null').joins(:category)


  but when you join, you have to make sure SQL field names are not ambiguous:
    Post.published.joins(:comments)

    scope :published, where('posts.published_at is not null')


  - you can chain scopes
  scope :published_and_commented, published.joins(:comments).group('comments.post_id').having('count(*) > 0')


  - and you can call them on the class:

    Post.published_and_commented

  - or on an association of the class objects:

    Category.first.posts.published



  - Working with times
    - If you’re working with dates or times within scopes, due to how they are evaluated, you will need to use a lambda so that the scope is evaluated every time.

      scope :last_week, lambda { where("published_at > ?", Time.zone.now.ago(1.week) ) }

    - Without the lambda, this Time.zone.now will only be called once in production environment - and you end up with the wrong records...


  - When a lambda is used for a scope, it can take arguments:

    scope :one_week_before, lambda { |time| where(published_at: (time.ago(1.week)..time) }

    Post.one_week_before(Time.zone.now)

  - However, this is just duplicating the functionality that would be provided to you by a class method.

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      def self.one_week_before(time)
        where(published_at: (time.ago(1.week)..time)
      end
    end


  - Using a class method is the preferred way to accept arguments for scopes. These methods will still be accessible on the association objects:

    Category.first.posts.one_week_before(Time.zone.now)


  - you can set a "default_scope"

    default_scope where("posts.published_at IS NOT NULL").order(:published_at).reverse_order

  - You can remove all scopes with ".unscoped" - particularly for when removing a default_scope
