# homework review | 9:00 - 10:00
- James' homework from Friday 
    
# TDD | 10:00 - 12:00
- What is testing?

- When do we test? After we've coded?
  - What's the limitations of this?
    Do you get to make the time? Will your PM let you... ?
    ...or make you get onto the next bit of functionality...

- Create a Bank Account app using TDD:
    gem install rspec
    mkdir bank_account
    cd bank_account
    mkdir spec
    touch spec/spec_helper.rb
    touch spec/bank_spec.rb
    subl .
    
    paste code from spec_helper.rb
    
    rspec spec
    
    # add test to bank_spec
    
    touch bank.rb
    # add Bank class
    
    Follow through TDD notes from w1d5

# break @ | 10:30 - 10:45
- TDD continued
    
- Stubs/Mocks
  - Tests should only try to test one thing. And be repeatable.
  - If there's some complicated logic in your code, the you can "stub" it out to test other simpler parts.
  
- Limits of tests
  - Written by us: if we write bad tests, they're not much use
  - If they don't cover all the code, they can be a false reassurance

- Often, one person writes a test, another person writes the code, then swap
  - Or the tests are written in planning by the group, and then the implementation is shared out
  - or whatever works for you
  
- If there's time: Guard
  gem install guard guard-rspec; guard -i
