# Intro to Rails - re-rolling | 9:45 - 10:45
- What is Rails
  - Web app framework we've been building up to
    Focussed on the MVC pattern.

                                          -----> Model <----> DB
                                         |         |
            response        request      |         |
   Browser <-------- router -------> controller <-- 
                             GET         ^
                             PUT         |
                             POST         -----> view <----> html/images/css/js
                             DELETE
       
       
    - in Sinatra we had (effectively) one "controller" - Rails lets us have many

- some of this never wants to go into github... so use a .gitignore
  example in my apps folder

# Lunch | 12:00 - 13:00

# Routing and views | 13:00 - 14:00
- Routing is how web-browser requests get directed to actions in controllers
- Combination of HTTP verb (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) and the path (/www.website.co.uk/person/3)

- in Sinatra we define with:
  get '/video' {}
  post '/new' {}

- Rails has a "routing engine" that separates this from the controller.

  touch app/controllers/home_controller.rb

  class HomeController < ApplicationController
    def about_us
      render text: "hello from Rails! This is all about us..."
    end
  end

- Rails.root/config/routes.rb
  delete all the comments and replace with:
    get '/about_us', to: 'home#about_us'
    
  then:
    rails s
    http://localhost:3000
  
    http://localhost:3000/about_us
    
    rake routes
    
- add some more:

  faq... map... terms_and_conditions
  
- Views
  Just like in sinatra, we have a directory for views, and everything for the user goes in there

  mkdir app/views/home
  
  touch app/views/home/about_us.html.erb
  # move the "render" text into here...
  
  same for faq, etc.
  
- layouts? already there....

- add some navigation links
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href='/home'>HOME</a></li>
        <li><a href='/about'>ABOUT</a></li>
        <li><a href='/faq'>FAQ</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    
- root route
    root to: 'home#homepage'
    touch app/views/home/home_page.html.erb
    
    doesn't work...
    ...what does it say?
    "delete public/index.html"

# View helpers | 14:00 - 15:00
- Rails extends Ruby... it offers us a lot more "helper" functionality on top of the Ruby basics.
  - For instance:
    ".blank?"
    ".to_sentence"

- Specific view helpers
  - Generally designed to make our life easier; to simplify common tasks in views
  - Generate HTML elements
  - Standardise display

- There's a lot of them!
  http://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/

- Let's have a play in our homepage.
  
- Some common/frequent use:
  - UrlHelper:
    link_to
      :confirm - JS that we've not covered yet... but we don't need to - Rails does it for us
  
  - FormTagHelper (and FormHelper)
    form_tag
      <%= form_tag('/posts') do -%>
        <div><%= submit_tag 'Save' %></div>
      <% end -%>

    text_field_tag 'ip', '0.0.0.0', :maxlength => 15, :size => 20, :class => "ip-input"

  - NumberHelper
    number_to_currency
      number_to_currency(1234567890.50, :unit => "&pound;", :separator => ",")

    number_to_human
      number_to_human(1234)                                         # => "1.23 Thousand"
      number_to_human(12345)                            # => "12.3 Thousand"
      number_to_human(1234567)                          # => "1.23 Million"
      number_to_human(1234567890)                       # => "1.23 Billion"
      number_to_human(1234567890123)                    # => "1.23 Trillion"
      number_to_human(1234567890123456)                 # => "1.23 Quadrillion"
      number_to_human(1234567890123456789)              # => "1230 Quadrillion"
      number_to_human(489939, :precision => 2)

    number_to_human_size
      number_to_human_size(1234567890)                  # => 1.15 GB
      
  - DateHelper
    distance_of_time_in_words(from_time, to_time = 0, include_seconds = false, options = {})
    time_ago_in_words(from_time, include_seconds = false, options = {}) public
  
  - TextHelper
    pluralize
    pluralize(1, 'person')  # => 1 person
    pluralize(2, 'person')  # => 2 people
    pluralize(3, 'person', 'users')  # => 3 users
    
    truncate("Once upon a time in a world far far away") # => "Once upon a time in a world..."
    
  - TagHelper
    tag
    tag("br")
    tag("div", :data => {:name => 'Stephen', :city_state => %w(Chicago IL)}) 
    tag("input", :type => 'text', :disabled => true) # note the options hash is not wrapped in hash-tags
    tag("input", {:type => 'text', :disabled => true}) # you'll see this a lot in Rails

    content_tag(:div, "Hello world!")
    <%= content_tag :div, :class => "strong" do -%>
      Hello world!
    <% end -%>

# routing and views lab | 15:15 - 17:00
- Routing 1,2,3
  Create a /start page with links to an A page and a B page. Create a home controller with all the actions in it. Add a form with an input and a button. The user can enter a 1, 2, or 3. The forms work the same way as they do in Sinatra. When the button is clicked, it could be a GET or a POST, but since we are not changing data, you can use a GET. Send the user to a page with the number they entered on it.

  # routes.rb
  get '/start' => 'home#start'
  get '/a' => 'home#a'
  get '/b' => 'home#b'
  get '/1' => 'home#one'
  get '/2' => 'home#two'
  get '/3' => 'home#three'
  get '/door' => 'home#door'
  root :to => 'home#start'

  # home controller
  class HomeController < ApplicationController
    def start
      render 'menu'
    end

    def a
      @which_action = 'a'
      render 'menu'
    end

    def b
      @which_action = 'b'
      render 'menu'
    end

    def one
      @which_action = 1
      render 'menu'
    end

    def two
      @which_action = 2
      render 'menu'
    end

    def three
      @which_action = 3
      render 'menu'
    end

    def door
      case params['option'].downcase
        when 'a' then redirect_to('/a')
        when 'b' then redirect_to('/b')
        when '1' then redirect_to('/1')
        when '2' then redirect_to('/2')
        when '3' then redirect_to('/3')
        else render 'menu'
      end
    end
  end

  # views/home/menu.html.erb
  <a href='/a'>a</a><br>
  <a href='/b'>b</a><br>

  <form action='/door' method='get'>
    <input type='text' name='option'>
    <button>go!</button>
  </form>


- Fanzine
  - Create a Rails app for a pop-band fan club. Have pages for each member of the band, their tour dates, image gallery. Bonus points for multiple pages per band member.
  

# Homework - MTA on Rails
- Take the MTA app from week one, and put those subway lines on Rails
  - If you want a challenge to extend the logic, add the "7" line, which has stops at Times Square, 42nd, 5th Ave, Grand Central, and Vernon-Jackson - with intersections at TS (N line) and GC (6 line) :-)
