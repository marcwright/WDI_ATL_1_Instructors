- Movies app

  rails new movies -d postgresql

  touch app/models/movie.rb

  pry-rails to gemfile

  edit database.yml
    - what is YAML?

    - alter DB name, user, etc

  # movie.rb
  class Movie < ActiveRecord::Base
  end

    - what is "active_record"?
      ORM
      "An object that wraps a row in a database table or view, encapuslates the database access, and adds domain logic on that data" Martin Fowler

      It makes the easy SQL stuff trivial, and the hard SQL stuff possible.

      One table maps to one Ruby class (there is such a thing as Single Table Inheritance though, but it's not for whimsy...)

      Columns map to methods, and are inferred from the schema.

    
    http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v3.2.13/active_record_querying.html

    rails c

    Movie

    Movie.count

    Movie.all.class

    Movie.all

    Movie.where(id: 1) # make sure the id exists!

    Movie.find(1)

    # note the difference that "where" returns an array, while "find" returns a single object - recall the clunkyness of having to do this manually in Sinatra

    Movie.where(year: %w(1999 1994 1986))

    Movie.where(["year in (?)", %w(1999 1994 1986)])

    Movie.where(["year in (:years)", years: %w(1999 1994 1986)])

    Movie.order(:genre)

    Movie.order('genre DESC')

    Movie.where(year: %w(1999 1994 1986)).order(:genre)

  - Create and retrive

    m = Movie.new
    m.title = "Star Wars"
    m.year = 1977
    m.save
    Movie.last

    m = Movie.new(title: "The Empire Strikes Back")
    m.save
    Movie.last

    m = Movie.create(title: "The Return of the Jedi")
    Movie.last

    m = Movie.find_by_title("Star Wars")

    Movie.find_all_by_title("Star Wars")

    m.update_attributes(title: "Star Wars: A New Hope", genre: "space opera") 
    m = Movie.find_by_title("Star Wars")

    m.destroy
    # There is a ".delete", but stick to '.destroy' as it does more that just fire a DB query


# break | 10:45 - 11:00

# Migrations | 11:00 - 12:00
- Migrations are a way for us to manage the creation and alteration of our database tables in a structured and organized manner.

- Each migration is a seperate file, which Rails runs for us when we instruct it. Rails keeps track of what's been run, so changes don't get attempted more than once.

- We describe the DB changes using Ruby, and it doesn't matter which DB engine we use - Rails has connectors for each different DB engine we might use, which translates the ruby structure into the appropriate DB commands.

- Let's create a migration:
  rails new migrations_app # without specifying a DB, Rails will use SQLite3)

  touch app/db/migrate/20130702101500_create_products.rb

  class CreateProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def up
      create_table :products do |t|
        t.string :name
        t.text :description
   
        t.timestamps
      end
    end
   
    def down
      drop_table :products
    end
  end

  - We'll re-write this migration to use an even simpler syntax:
    
    class CreateProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def change
        create_table :products do |t|
          t.string :name
          t.text :description
     
          t.timestamps
        end
      end
    end

    run migrations with:

    rake db:migrate

    # read the screen... did it run?

    sqlite3 db/development.sqlite3

    .schema products

    .exit

  - Add columns:
    - Rails gives us some help to generate migration files:
      rails generate migration AddPriceAndAvailabilityToProducts price:integer available:boolean
      - by putting Add....To.... Rails knows we are adding these columns to which table, and the migration can be written automatically

      - available column types:
        :binary
        :boolean
        :date
        :datetime
        :decimal
        :float
        :integer
        :primary_key
        :string
        :text
        :time
        :timestamp

  - When migrations run, Rails also updates the schema.rb file - it contains the migration commands all combined into each table.
    cat db/schema.rb

  - We can undo running migrations with:
    rake db:rollback

    - beware:
      don't rollback migrations which have been run on other machines (essentially, if they're in source code control)

      - instead, write a new migration to undo the changes


  - Models and Migrations
    - Since AR models map to tables, when you create a model, it should create a table migration

      rails g model Customer name:string description:text active:boolean credit_limit:decimal last_contact_at:datetime


  - Removing columns
    - we can use the same naming convention as create to automatically generate the file

      rails g migration RemoveNameFromCustomers name:string

      - notice it has "up" and "down"... there isn't enough information in the 'down' to do a "change"


# Lunch | 12:00 - 13:00

# Planets App Code-Along | 13:00 - 15:00
  -- NOTE: ensure to cover routing for resources, and the controller actions, generate scaffold

  - Create an app to store astronomical information about the planets 
  - Each planet has a name, an image, an orbit (how far it is from the sun), a diameter, a mass, and a number of moons. (Note: 1 AU is the distance between Earth and the Sun.) This sounds a bit like some of the object-oriented programming we did last week.

  rails new planets -d postgresql

  - check the gemfile and the database.yaml
  - gitignore?

  - in SQLite, Rails will create the database file for us, but in Postgres we have to create the DB - but Rails gives us a command (which will create a DB whatever the engine we use - so we only need to remember one command)

    rake db:create

  rails g model Planet name:string image:text orbit:float diameter:float mass:float moons:integer

  - edit the migration and add "limit: 2" to the moons field definition

    rake db:migrate

  - look at the planet.rb model in editor
    - note the "attr_accessible"

  p = Planet.create({:name => 'Earth', :moons => 1, :orbit => 1})
  p2 = Planet.create({:name => 'Mars', :moons => 2, :orbit => 1.5})
  p3 = Planet.create(:name => 'Jupiter', :moons => 67, :orbit => 5.2)

  Planet.all

  - DB seeds

    Paste the above lines into db/seeds.rb

    Planet.delete_all

    rake db:seed

    
  - Routing

# Homework - GAMC App
- You work for the General Assembly Motor Company
- Your sales dealership network need an application to manage the range of makes and models of cars in the company (past and present models)
- Your homework *must* include some feature/helper of Rails we have not covered in class (we're doing Associations and View Partials tomorrow...so no points for that ;-) - something in Models, ActiveRecord queries, View Helpers, Migrations, Controller actions
- Use the Ruby skills we've covered so far to best effect - DRY; clear code; conventions; enumerators.
