  Something that is exceptional
  Something we didn't expect
  
- What exceptions have we seen?
  NoMethodError, ArgumentError, NameError, SyntaxError, ZeroDivisionError, RuntimeError

- How can we handle something we don't expect??

# File I/O | 11:15 - 12:00
- So far, all of our data has been volitile - just held in memory
  As soon as we 'exit' it's all gone
  
- One way of persisting data is to use the file system
  We're already doing this manually by editing files in Sublime.
  Let's do it in Ruby.
  
- work through creating files

- work through reading files

- If time: add ".save" to the Person class

- Point to the Ruby api for File and Dir
