  - Let's restart our Rails app development... we've been working on Cookbook all week, so let's go back and practice one more time.

  - We want an app that will act as a DB of all the movies we've watched.
  - We should be able to store the title of the movie, our review of it, and whether we watched it at the cinema, on TV, or on DVD (and if we own the DVD, or it was rented)
  - We can link off to the OMDB API (like we did for our Sinatra movie app) by using HTTParty gem, to fill in other attributes about the movie
