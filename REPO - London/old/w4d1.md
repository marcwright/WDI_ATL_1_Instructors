# Coffee & Scrum | 9:00 - 9:30
  - "so I'm fucked then. I spent two hours building a filter. Then another 2 constructing a viewer, and the two aren't compatible"

# Validations | 9:30 - 10:45
  - copy the 'associations' app from w3d4

  - ActiveRecord object either correspond to a DB row, or they've not been saved yet.

  c = Customer.new(:name => "John Doe")
  c.new_record?
  c.save
  c.new_record?

  - Validations are run before a record is saved. If any validations fail, the object does not get saved to the database.

  - Some AR methods do skip validations, but create, save, and update_attributes (and their bang alternatives) require validations to pass.
    - To skip manually:
      c.save(validate: false)

  - To check manually:
    .valid?
    .invalid?

  - Any errors are placed into the .errors collection

    # customer.rb
    validates :name, presence: true

    c = Customer.new
    c.errors # .to_a
    c.valid?
    c.errors # .to_a

    c.save
    c.save!
    c.name = "gimme a name"

    c.save

  - Some validations:
    presence

    length
      validates :name, :length => { :minimum => 2 } 
      validates :bio, :length => { :maximum => 500 }
      validates :password, :length => { :in => 8..255 }
 
    numericality
      validates :points, :numericality => true
      validates :games_played, :numericality => { :only_integer => true }
      - also allows for :greater_than, :less_than, :odd, :even, :equal, et al.

    uniqeness
      validates :email, :uniqueness => true

  - lots more besides
    We're not going into them, they're in the api

  - Conditionally validating
    - Sometimes we only want to validate if certain conditions are met: 
 
    - :if and :unless

      # with symbol for method
      class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
        validates :card_number, :presence => true, :if => :paid_with_card?
       
        def paid_with_card?
          payment_type == "card"
        end
      end

      # with Proc
      class User < ActiveRecord::Base
        validates :password, :confirmation => true, :unless => Proc.new { |u| u.user.blank? }
      end

    - :on
      Lets you specify when the validation should take place - create/update/save (defaults to 'save')

      class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
        # it will be possible to update email with a duplicated value
        validates :email, :uniqueness => true, :on => :create
       
        # it will be possible to create the record with a non-numerical age
        validates :age, :numericality => true, :on => :update
       
        # the default (validates on both create and update)
        validates :name, :presence => true, :on => :save
      end

  - Custom Validation 
    - write your own methods to verify the state of your objects

      class Invoice < ActiveRecord::Base
        validate :active_customer, :on => :create
       
        def active_customer
          errors.add(:customer_id, "is not active") unless customer.active?
        end
      end

  - Errors object
    c.errors.class

    - retrieve errors by attribute name
      c.errors[:name]

    - adding to errors
      We saw this in the custom validator
        c.errors.add(:name, "too hard to spell")

    - if the error doesn't match a certain field, add to the object's base
      c.errors[:base] << "This customer is invalid because ..."

    - all errors
      c.errors.full_messages

    - errors in views
      - look in scaffold

 - Filters are methods that are run before, after or “around” a controller action


   - Login example
      class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
        before_filter :require_login
       
        def current_user
          if current_user_id = session[:current_user_id]
            User.find(current_user_id)
          end
        end

        private
        def require_login
          unless logged_in?
            flash[:error] = "You must be logged in to access this section"
            redirect_to new_login_url # halts request cycle
          end
        end
       
        def logged_in?
          !!current_user
        end

      end

    - Problem is, not *every* action needs the filter... otherwise how would we login in the first place?

      class LoginsController < ApplicationController
        skip_before_filter :require_login, only: [:new, :create]
      end


    - example of filter use:
      class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
        before_filter :authenticate
        around_filter :catch_exceptions
      end

      class WeblogController < ApplicationController
        # Will run the :authenticate and :catch_exceptions filters.
      end

      class SignupController < ApplicationController
        # Skip :authenticate, run :catch_exceptions.
        skip_before_filter :authenticate
      end

      class ProjectsController < ApplicationController
        # Skip :catch_exceptions, run :authenticate.
        skip_filter :catch_exceptions
      end

      class ClientsController < ApplicationController
        # Skip :catch_exceptions and :authenticate unless action is index.
        skip_filter :catch_exceptions, :authenticate, :except => :index
      end


    - around_filters

        private
        def catch_exceptions
          yield
        rescue => exception
          logger.debug "Caught exception! #{exception}"
          raise
        end

- private/public methods
  By default, all methods in Ruby classes are public - accessible by anyone.

  If desired, the visibility for methods can be restricted by public, private, protected object methods.

  Essentially this means whether they can be called on an object.

  "private" methods can only be accessed by the instance itself (though it cannot call "self.some_private_method" - it has to call the local scope "some_private_method")

  "public" can be called by anyone.

  "protected" we'll skip. If you want to know ask me later, but it's rarely used.

  As with everything in Ruby - it's not hard-and-fast. And it's possible to access private methods - the point is to indicate that maybe the coder didn't intend for us to.

  - Beware of hanging "private" calls
    - Every method after a "private" is private until "public" (or protected) is called.

    I would recommend putting all your private methods at the bottom of the class - additionally, define "private" in front of each, to be explicit, and prevent hiccups when refactoring.


- Callbacks
  Like filters, but for ActiveRecord models. They're methods that get called at certain times in an object's lifecycle.

  - Callbacks are registed in the class, and generally are defined like this

    before_validation :ensure_login_has_a_value
    before_save :normalize_card_number, :if => :paid_with_card?

  - but can take a block
    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      after_initialize do |user|
        puts "You have initialized a User object!"
      end
    end

  - or can be individual methods:
    def before_save
      puts 'before save'
    end

    def after_save
      puts 'after_save'
    end

    def around_save
      puts 'in around save'
      yield
      puts 'out around save'
    end

  - There are callbacks called when creating, updating and destroying objects:

    - Creating an Object
      before_validation
      after_validation
      before_save
      around_save
      before_create
      around_create
      after_create
      after_save

    - Updating an Object
      before_validation
      after_validation
      before_save
      around_save
      before_update
      around_update
      after_update
      after_save

    - Destroying an Object
      before_destroy
      around_destroy
      after_destroy
