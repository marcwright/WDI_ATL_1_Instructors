# Filters & Callbacks | 1hr 15mins

## private/public methods
  By default, all methods in Ruby classes are public - accessible by anyone.

  If desired, the visibility for methods can be restricted by public, private, protected object methods.

  Essentially this means whether they can be called on an object.

  "private" methods can only be accessed by the instance itself (though it cannot call "self.some_private_method" - it has to call the local scope "some_private_method")

  "public" can be called by anyone.

  "protected" we'll skip. If you want to know ask me later, but it's rarely used.

  As with everything in Ruby - it's not hard-and-fast. And it's possible to access private methods - the point is to indicate that maybe the coder didn't intend for us to.

  - Beware of hanging "private" calls
    - Every method after a "private" is private until "public" (or protected) is called.

    I would recommend putting all your private methods at the bottom of the class - additionally, define "private" in front of each, to be explicit, and prevent hiccups when refactoring.



## Filters

- setup app to play in:
  
  rails new facebook_app
  cd facebook_app
  rails g scaffold User name dob:date
  rails g controller sessions new create destroy

  - routes:
    resources :users
    get '/login', to: 'sessions#new', as: :new_login
    get '/logout', to: 'sessions#destroy', as: :logout
    get '/fake', to: 'sessions#create', as: :fake_login


- Filters are methods that are run before, after or “around” a controller action
  
   - Login example
      class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
        before_filter :require_login
       
        def current_user
          if current_user_id = session[:current_user_id]
            User.find(current_user_id)
          end
        end

        private
        def require_login
          unless logged_in?
            flash[:error] = "You must be logged in to access this section"
            redirect_to new_login_path # halts request cycle
          end
        end
       
        private
        def logged_in?
          !!current_user
        end

      end

    - Problem is, not *every* action needs the filter... otherwise how would we login in the first place?

      class LoginsController < ApplicationController
        skip_before_filter :require_login, only: [:new, :create]
      end


    - example of filter use:
      class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
        before_filter :authenticate
        around_filter :catch_exceptions
      end

      class WeblogController < ApplicationController
        # Will run the :authenticate and :catch_exceptions filters.
      end

      class SignupController < ApplicationController
        # Skip :authenticate, run :catch_exceptions.
        skip_before_filter :authenticate
      end

      class ProjectsController < ApplicationController
        # Skip :catch_exceptions, run :authenticate.
        skip_filter :catch_exceptions
      end

      class ClientsController < ApplicationController
        # Skip :catch_exceptions and :authenticate unless action is index.
        skip_filter :catch_exceptions, :authenticate, :except => :index
      end


    - around_filters

        private
        def catch_exceptions
          yield
        rescue => exception
          logger.debug "Caught exception! #{exception}"
          raise
        end



## Callbacks
  Like filters, but for ActiveRecord models. They're methods that get called at certain times in an object's lifecycle.

  - Callbacks are registed in the class, and generally are defined like this

    before_validation :ensure_login_has_a_value
    before_save :normalize_card_number, :if => :paid_with_card?

  - but can take a block
    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      after_initialize do |user|
        puts "You have initialized a User object!"
      end
    end

  - or can be individual methods:
    def before_save
      puts 'before save'
    end

    def after_save
      puts 'after_save'
    end

    def around_save
      puts 'in around save'
      yield
      puts 'out around save'
    end

  - There are callbacks called when creating, updating and destroying objects:

    - Creating an Object
      before_validation
      after_validation
      before_save
      around_save
      before_create
      around_create
      after_create
      after_save

    - Updating an Object
      before_validation
      after_validation
      before_save
      around_save
      before_update
      around_update
      after_update
      after_save

    - Destroying an Object
      before_destroy
      around_destroy
      after_destroy
