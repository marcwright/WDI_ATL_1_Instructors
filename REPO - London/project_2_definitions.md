## Cheerups
The world is a depressing place, we're all staring at our shoes.

Your task is to create an app that will allow people to create and share "cheerups" - happy little quips to brighten other peoples' days. Cheerups will be small - limited to 141 characters. Members will be able to promote Cheerups that they like, which will increase their prominence, and boost the reputation of the Cheerupper.

We expect to attract people who are amused by spoiling things for others... if members are rated as "Dragdowners", their reputation and prominence will suffer.

## Photo sharing app
You will need to create a photo sharing application.

Users will be able to register and create albums and photos. Albums and photos will need to be named and described by their owners; and they will also be able to tag photos, and make tags searchable. Users will be able to view other users albums. They will be able to comment on the photos, and either up vote or down vote them. The homepage will display the most popular photos.

## Feed aggregator
You will create an application to retrieve and save rss feeds into a database.

Users should be able to subscribe and manage their accounts, manage the feeds they wants to follow, archive / bookmark / socially publish the posts and define a feed that they follow as public or private on their profile and see other users profiles and feeds.

The efficiency of the DB is a primary concern - multiple subscriptions to a single feed should cause it to be stored only once.

## WiFi Network Retention
Our target is frequent travellers around the country; every time they visit a new B&B or office, they get the network credentials, but don't always have the same laptop when they visit again.

We want to be able to store (and maybe share ... with selected people) the location of the network, its SSID, and its authentication details.

We want to be able to easily find the details for networks when users are next back at the location.

## Dating website
Online dating is a Â£44b industry. Produce a new online dating platform, allowing lonely single tech-workers to hook up and find true love.

The users of your new platform should be able to search for other people based on age, sex, etc, view other people's profiles (but these views will be tracked and shown to the profile owner) and send private, secure messages.

Model your membership levels to allow new users a limited taster of the facilities you provide, and the ability to upgrade to a full/premium scheme.
