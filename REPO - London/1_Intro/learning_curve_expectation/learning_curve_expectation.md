# WDI Learning Curve

Before doing the 'Ruby Basics' lesson, we need to do the "learning curve" expectation for the next 12 weeks... they've had a day so far, so they might now have an idea of the level of work involved...


## What's all the fuss about

It's been mentioned that the course is 'immersive', and that it's hard work, and a lot of effort. But that effort isn't really evenly spread over the course.

* Draw a graph, with twelve weeks along the x-axis and 'new learning' on the y-axis graded from 'easy' to 'omg brain melt' (or something equally arbitrary)
* Draw a line that covers 70% of the y-axis in the first three weeks, and then levels out to cover the remaining 30% over the next 9 weeks.

Then talk about how the first three weeks are a whole bunch of new information that they've never experienced before, and that the majority of the rest of the course is a mix of:
  - variations on these new concepts
  - practice at applying them
  - small enhancements and additions to the learning

But if they've made it to the top of that three week curve, they're well prepared for the rest of the course.

So don't worry too much if it gets hard - it's supposed to. But it should not be too long before what was hard before seems easy (and something new can be hard :-)
