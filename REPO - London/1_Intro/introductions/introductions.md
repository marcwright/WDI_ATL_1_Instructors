# Introduction - Get to know each other & set course expectations

This lesson takes about an hour, to an hour-and-a-half, depending on the discussions around culture and what questions get asked - it's the students' first time in the room, so there's some group forming going on. Help it out with the couple of opportunities to discuss in small groups.

## Introduction
- Introduce the team, instructor, TAs, other staff  - 10mins
- Get students to talk to each other - Names, why are you here (and maybe the 'what's your guilty pleasure?') 2 mins each
- Surprise! Tell the class about the person next to you. 1 min each

(while emails are being sent to you inviting you to Hipchat and Moodswings...)

## Class Culture
- how do they want to treat each other?
- how do they want to work together?
- how do they want to be treated by the instructor team?
- how do they want to treat the instructor team?
- what do they want to do about mobiles/facebook?
- what do they want to do if someone misses classes?
- Break into groups (4-ish) and get them to discuss what they want their training to be like - 5-10mins
- Discuss their answers - 15mins

Previous rules:

* Class Rules:

  1. Respect fellow classmates and instructional team.
  2. One person talks at a time during teaching time.
  3. We expect you to attend all lessons and labs. Please inform the instructional team in advance if you know you will miss a session. (to qualify for post-course opportunities, only 2 days )
  4. Arrive on time. Latecomers really distract the class.
  5. No distracting games or videos (You will be silenced).
  6. Silence mobiles. Absolutely no calls in class.
  7. Instructional team will be patient and courteous with students.
  8. We should encourage a collaborative environment within the classroom.

* Expectations:

  1. You will need to work after hours to keep up with the course work.
  2. Take advantage of the instructional team, we are here to support you.
    a. obviously in class time
    b. but also via hip-chat if we’re online
  3. Help each other, you will be experiencing the same problems.
  4. Make your mistakes in the classroom, this will help you to develop.
  5. Repetition is the key, especially in the first three weeks.
  6. Do class exercises, labs, homework. Additional apps on top of this will be an advantage.
  7. Be vocal about things you do not understand. Chances are you will not be the only person in the same position, we will reiterate until everyone understands.
  8. Try and blog or keep a diary of your progress. This will help you understand your own progress.


## This Week...
- explain the expectation for the coming week

- Installfest today
- Study Hall for the rest of the week

## 30th
- Lessons start 30th June; straight into it 
- Day one is some more environment fundementals
- Day two, getting on with it..
- etc...

## Class Structure/overview
- Daily flow - lecture/workshop/homework
- The "I" of WDI is "immersive" - there'll be little in the way of slideshows, and much in the way of diving through code
  - Type stuff to learn it - if you copy and paste commands across HipChat (though you're welcome to) you will learn less
- A whole lot of coding, during class and after, especially after with homework
  - I'd recommend Friday evenings off - but pencil out the rest of your calendar for the next three months
  - Parties at weekends? Bad plan...
- Projects to pull all the ideas together
- 1:1’s / Reflection Time
  - Encourage Blogging/Tweeting
