# Reflection (45mins)

- Half hour of quite reflection
- Instructors are out of the room
- Video playing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyU3bRy2x44
- Reflect quietly on the week - try not to talk at all, to allow other students to reflect
- Look through your notes 
  - any questions?
  - areas you particularly liked?
  - or found hard?
- Write up feelings/experience for blog/portfolio
- Opportunity to note down anything you'd like to talk about in 1:1
