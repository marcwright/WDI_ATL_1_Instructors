# Andy - Algorithms

Asked the class what they already knew about algorithms.

Defined it, and then asked about the cake picture 
(recipe example) - using a slide-show presentation

Then some more real world examples

More specific example: going to the cinema

Representation as pseudo-code.

Flow chart.

Exercise to write an algorithm.

How to Shower…
If Bathroom is free
Enter it
Remove clothes
Turn on taps
Is water warm enough? Wait if not …
Enter shower
Get wet all over
lather soap all over
rinse all over
Turn off taps
Grab towel
Dry all over - between toes
get out of shower
get dressed
leave bathroom

Students present algorithms

Choosing between four different… time and cost implications

Efficiency.

'Big O' notation

# Mark - Data Types

Set outcomes for lesson

Real life examples
shopping (types of goods; frozen, cooked, raw, chemicals)
accents

Definition in computing

Primitive data types
bit, byte, word

Less primitive
character, int

Dynamic and static types

Why data types matter
efficient use of space

Benefits of data types.







# Max N - Sorting Algorithms

Handed out cards for people to sort

Worked through three sorts
bubble
insertion
another…

Then looking at best/worst/average case

Quick sort





# Richill - Dining Philosophers


Framing the lesson

Explains the problem
starvation
deadlock

Draws on the board





# Nico - Node.js

“Subway” analogy for Node.js async I/O

Drawing Expectations and Benefits on the board

Explaining about server-side javascript

Reading theoretical description of Node.js

Video of theory

"school" enrollment analogy of async I/O

Event Loop explanation



# Nikolas - Pointers

Intro - what are pointers

Referencing and Dereferencing

Why pointers?

- passing by reference
- dynamic memory
- complex data structures (linked lists, etc)

Are they good?

- it depends

Disadvantages?

- seg faults
- memory leaks
- can be slow
- can be fragile
- can be hard to decipher

Why do I care?

- experiment in IRB



# Imran - Promises

Framing for lesson

Recap of async events and callbacks

Ugly callbacks... 'callback hell', dependent on each other

Pitfalls of callbacks

- nested code becomes hard to read
- dealing with errors is hard
- timing multiple events can get confusing

Real World Promises

jQuery promises

- it's an object - a `deferred` object

Promise object attrributes

- state
- immutable
- listeners
- 'thenable'
- 'whenable'

Promise method

- instanciate a deferred object, and call `.promise()`

Triggering with `.resolve()`

Untangling Spaghetti Code




# Tim - Leaky Bucket


Description of laptop connected to network, and packets

Inconsitent traffic

Why do we want to shape traffic

- benefits to ISP
- prioritisation

How do we shape traffic?

Overflowing bucket




# Tom - Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages


Overview

It's about converting human-readable into computer-readable code.

Pros and cons.

Examples of each.

What do compiled languages do.

How do they work.

Benefits of interpreted code.

Game - translate binary into rap - compiled vs interpreted



# Laurent - Chinese Room

Is AI possible? Could it be created?

The thought experiment that an outerspace shaolin monk can communicate in written Chinese and be indistinguishable from a 'native' speaker.

Attempts to 'prove' John Searle wrong.





problems with Chinese room:

define 'native' 
what do you think is 'fundamentally different'






# Kriszta - Design Patterns

Generally repeatable solutions to commonly occurring problems





# Max -Minimalist Design
