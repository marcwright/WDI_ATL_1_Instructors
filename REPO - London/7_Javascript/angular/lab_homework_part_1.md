Angular Project - Homework and Lab time
=======================================

It is your task over the next couple of days to build an angular app. This should be done in the homework folder and we expect pull requests as usual!  

Your task is to build a class directory for your WDI cohort. It should list all the students in the class.  There should be info about each student, contact details and a list of projects.  You can include any additional info functionality that you want.

You should try and use each of the "ng-" functions that we covered this morning:  "ng-show", "ng-click", "ng-model", "ng-repeat", "ng-filter"

Try and find one new angular function and include it in your app. Perhaps try one of the ones that is familiar from jquery such as ng-mouseover. List of options: <https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive>   

If you want inspiration browse some of these websites: <https://builtwith.angularjs.org/>  
(tomorrow we will work on forms and validation and also start using Rails as an API so no need to work on those areas)

You should easily cover what we have covered in class during the afternoon lab and homework.  Here is some additional stuff to cover:


Frontend
---------

* Use the app to practice your front end skills - try and include a css attribute you haven't used before. See if you can get 'ng-animate' to work.
* Make your app responsive - prospective employers will be looking at this app on their phones.

Project 2
---------

* Make sure you have forked the group project into your own directory on github so that you have a copy.
* Make sure your readme is up to date (also update project 1's readme)
* Fix any bugs for your first project.
* Tidy up styling and anything you didn't have time for last week.
* Add at least one test to your project.

Testing
-------

* Try any of the exercises here: <http://exercism.io/>

If you are stuck for work contact one of the instructors - we can set you tasks depending on what you want to improve.
