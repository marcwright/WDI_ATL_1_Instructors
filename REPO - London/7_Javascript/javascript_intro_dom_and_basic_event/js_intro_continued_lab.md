Calc-it Javascript
==================

## Pre-lab prep

- We've seen how we can ask the user questions. 
- We've seen how we can make things happen when buttons are clicked.
- We've seen how we can read input from the page, and output things to the page. 
- So, can we do Calc-it? 
- Yes we can! 

## Lab

- Do a basic calc-it in the browser. 
- Add, subtract, multiply, divide. 


Homework Advanced Calcit
========================

Build advanced calcit lab in the browser.  See if you can add some visual tweaks using javascript to assist the user.

## Basic:

Do basic arithmetic, adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing two numbers. We got a good head start on this feature today - let's complete it!

## Mortgage:

Calculate the monthly payment when given the other variables as input.

## BMI:

Calculate the BMI when given the height and weight.

## Distance:

MPG – what is the fuel efficiency of the car? $PG – how much does gas cost per gallon? 
Speed – how fast will you drive?

The output is a string: "Your trip will take 3.5 hours and cost $255.33."

For every 1 MPH over 60 MPH, reduce the the MPG by 2 MPG. (i.e. a car that normally gets 30 mpg would only get 28 mpg if its speed were 61 mph. Yes this gets silly at high speed where mpg goes to zero or gets negative.)

## Something Unique

Include your unique extra function from the sinatra advanced calcit.
