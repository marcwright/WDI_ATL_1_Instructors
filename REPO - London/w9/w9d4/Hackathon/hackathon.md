# HACKATHON

We're going to run a 24-hour hackathon!

Hackathons are a popular way of bring developers together

They commonly involve:
  - making useful software quickly
  - using APIs to do this (often the host's API)
  - talking to journalists
  - coffee, pizza and beer
  - late nights
  - fun (optional)


## Theme: Wrap, Scrape or Mix

### Wrap

Make a gem that wraps a (currently unwrapped) REST+JSON API.

It should make it easy for rubyists to consume the API.
=> e.g. wrap a new API from http://www.programmableweb.com/


### Scrape

Make a gem that scrapes a site or sites.

It should make it easy for rubyists to access the site content.
=> e.g. scrape a niche e-commerce site that lacks an API.


### Mix

Make a franken-gem that consumes 2 or more APIs to do something new.

It should be greater than the sum of its partsâ€¦
=> e.g. combine a news API (or feed) with a stock market API.


## Deliverables

* a working gem
* a rails app that demos your gem
* a demo presentation


## Format

work in pairs or alone
instructors are mentors


## Schedule

Now to 1pm tomorrow: planning + coding
GA + food/drink open until 10pm
Fri 2pm to pub-o'clock: demo presentations & vote
