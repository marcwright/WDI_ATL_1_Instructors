##RUBY ARRAYS

An array is an ordered list in Ruby. You can think about an array as a container for different objects. Arrays are indexed from left to right, and will start at 0. We identify an array from the `[]` square brackets. Arrays in ruby can hold different types of objects, as long as every object is comma separated.  

	array = ['obj1', 1, 'obj3']
	
You can declare an array using constructor notation:

	array = Array.new

We can also write an array using literal notation:  

	array = %w(obj1 obj2 obj3 obj4)

We can have any object in our array, including other arrays:  

	$ my_array = [[1,2,3,4],[4,5,6,7],[7,8,9,10]]

	$ my_array.length
	=> 3

	$ my_array[0].length 
	=> 4

	$ my_array[1][1]
	=> 5

###Array methods

To find all the methods which are available to us when using arrays use the command:  

	.methods

To find the length of our array we use:  

	.length

or  

	.size  

To find out if we have any values in our array we use:  

	.any?  

To get the first value 

	.first

To get the last value 

	.last 

To get a specific index (remember it starts at 0) we use `[1]`

Example:  

	$ my_array = [1,2,3,4,5]
		
	$ my_array[0]
	=> 1

To reverse lookup our array we use `[-1]`  
`$ my_array = [1,2,3,4,5]`  
`$ my_array[-1] ` RETURNS     `5`  
  
To flatten our arrays we use `.flatten` or  `.flatten! `

Example:  

	$ my_array = [[1,2,3,4],[4,5,6,7],[7,8,9,10]]  

	$ my_array.flatten
	=> [1,2,3,4,4,5,6,7,7,8,9,10]

To remove an element off the end of our array we use:  

	.pop
	
To remove an element from the beginning of our array use:  

	.shift
	 
To add an element back on to the front of the array use:  

	.unshift(x) 

To add an element back on to the end of our array, we use `.push(x)` or you may also see `<< x`

To insert an element at a specific index we use `.insert 2 "object"`, "2" being the index.
 
To remove an element at located a specific index we use `.delete_at(2)`, "2" being the index. 

We can turn a string into an array by using  `.split(x)`  
The variable we enter to our split method will tell Ruby at which point in the string you want to split on.  

Example:

	$ my_array = "hello there"
	
	$ my_array.split(" ")
	=> ["hello", "there"]

To turn our array back into a string, we use `.join(x)`
Again the variable we pass is the character that we want to join on. 
Alternatively we can use `.to_s`

To remove nil elements from our array we have the method:  

	.compact
	 
or  

	.compact!  

We can find elements in our array by using `.include?`

Example:  

	$ my_array = ["hi", "everyone"]
	
	$ my_array.include?("hi") 
	=> true

Other methods which return a boolean value are:  
`.none?`  
`.any?`  
`.empty?`  

To find the highest value in our array we use: (this also works for alphabetical characters.):  
`.max`

To find the smallest :  
`.min` 

To sort our array  we use  `.sort`  
Then to reverse this we use  `.reverse`  

We can add two arrays together using the `+`
 
	[1,2,3]+[3,4,5]
	=> [1,2,3,3,4,5]

To remove any duplicate elements we can use `_.uniq`  

We can use intersection on our arrays by using the `&`
 
	[1,2,3] & [3,4,5]
	=> [3]
