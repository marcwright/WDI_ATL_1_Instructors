# Lab Partners Lab (2hours)
  
- Working in pairs, the students should create an app that will randomly assign groups for the class. The app takes a group size as input and prints out what the groups are. If the class does not divide evenly into the group size, decide what to do with the remaining students.

- Demo the solution for the students if they need clarification on how the app works.

- Spend the last half-hour reviewing and presenting student solutions
