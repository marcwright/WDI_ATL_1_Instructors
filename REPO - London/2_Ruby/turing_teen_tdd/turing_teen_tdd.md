This is the class' first real look at TDD.

Introduce it as best practice, and this is practice at it. Take the test code and write the Ruby code required to make it pass.

Take them through running the test file (`ruby bob_test.rb`); explain the multi-page error for the first test failure; and then talk through making the first test pass fixing one error message at a time and explaining about the test output:

  - remove the first 'skip'
  - create a `bob.rb` file
  - add a `class Bob; end` definition
  - add a `hey` instance method
  - alter the `hey` method to take an argument
  - hard-code "Whatever" as the return value

Reiterate the 'red, green, refactor' loop, and remove the next "skip" and leave them to it.
