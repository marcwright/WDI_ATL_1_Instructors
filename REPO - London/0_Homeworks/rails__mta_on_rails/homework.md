# Homework - MTA on Rails
- Take the MTA app from week one, and put those subway lines on Rails
  - If you want a challenge to extend the logic, add the "7" line, which has stops at Times Square, 42nd, 5th Ave, Grand Central, and Vernon-Jackson - with intersections at TS (N line) and GC (6 line) :-)
