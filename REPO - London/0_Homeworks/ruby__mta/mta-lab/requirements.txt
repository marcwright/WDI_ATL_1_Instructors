# Overview
==========
Calculate stops between stations on subway lines.

## Tasks
========
Take the line and stop that a user is getting on at and the line and stop that user is getting off at and prints the total number of stops for the trip.

- There are 3 subway lines:

  - The N line has the following stops: 
    Times Square, 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and 8th

  - The L line has the following stops: 
    8th, 6th, Union Square, 3rd, and 1st 
    
  - The 6 line has the following stops: 
    Grand Central, 33rd, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and Astor Place.

- All 3 subway lines intersect at Union Square, but there are no other intersection points. 
  (For example, this means the 28th stop on the N line is different than the 28th stop on the 6 line.)


- Give students the following hints:

Get the program to work for a single line before trying to tackle multiple lines.
Diagram how the program works by drawing out the subway lines and their stops and intersection.
The subway lines are keys in a hash, while the values are an array of all the stops on each line.
The key to the lab is the intersection of the lines at Union Square. Google “ruby array intersect.”
Make sure the stops that are the same for different lines have different names (i.e. 23rd on the N and on the 6 need to be differentiated).
