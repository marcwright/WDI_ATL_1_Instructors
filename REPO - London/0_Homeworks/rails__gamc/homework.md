#Homework - GAMC App
* You work for the General Assembly Motor Company
* Your sales dealership network need an application to manage the range of makes and models of cars in the company (past and present models)
* Your homework must include some feature/helper of Rails we have not covered in class (we're doing Associations and View Partials tomorrow...so no points for that ;-) - something in Models, ActiveRecord queries, View Helpers, Migrations, Controller actions
* Use the Ruby skills we've covered so far to best effect - DRY; clear code; conventions; enumerators.

__NOTES FOR THE INSTRUCTOR: THE "SPECIAL BIT" IN THE EXAMPLE APP IS THAT WE USE VALIDATIONS FOR THE MODEL, ITS A GOOD WAY OF INTRODUCING THEM, AND STUDENTS ARE ALWAYS INTERESTED BY VALIDATING INPUT, ALSO THERE IS COLOURS SHOWN WITH RADIO BUTTON"__
