# Sort in Ruby

We've looked at some sorting algorithms, so let's try to write a bubble-sort.

The Bubble Sort algorithm repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.

# write the bubble_sort method

- We can add a counter to see how many times the algorithm loops for a random array, a fully sorted array, and a reverse sorted array

- Benchmark against the Ruby .sort method

- Paste the quicksort methods in, and benchmark with that too.

- Find a mergesort implementation and try that too?
