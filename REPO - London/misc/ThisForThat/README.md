## This for That

###Goals:
* Practice JavaScript syntax, writing JavaScript functions, and using JavaScript arrays

###Setup
Have you seen this [website](http://itsthisforthat.com/)? It's the inspiration for this exercise. We're going to recreate a console version of this site. What does your startup do? Let's practice using arrays to find out!

* Write a function called randomThis() that picks a random "This" element from the array
* Write a function called randomThat() that picks a random "That" element from the array
* Write a function that prints a statement saying: "So.... your startup is basically like a like a this for that?" It should print a new statement each time the function is called.
