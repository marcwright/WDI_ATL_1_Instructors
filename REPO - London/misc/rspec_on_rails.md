# RSpec on Rails

We're going to integrate RSpec into a Rails app.

    rails new cookbook_the_revenge
    cd cookbook_the_revenge

Edit the gemfile to add the required files.

    group :development, :test do
      gem 'rspec-rails', '2.14.1'
      gem 'factory_girl_rails'
    end

    group :test do
      gem 'faker'
      gem 'capybara'
      gem 'guard-rspec'
    end

## Why install in two separate groups? 

rspec-rails and factory_girl_rails are used in both the development and test environments. Specifically, they are used in development by generators we’ll be utilizing shortly. 

The remaining gems are only used when you actually run your specs, so they’re not necessary to load in development. This also ensures that gems used solely for generating code or running tests aren’t installed in your production environment when you deploy to your server.

Run `bundle` to install.

* rspec-rails includes RSpec itself in a wrapper to make it play nicely with Rails 3.
* factory_girl_rails replaces Rails’ default fixtures for feeding test data to the test suite with much more preferable factories (from ThoughtBot)
* faker generates names, email addresses, and other placeholders for factories.
* capybara makes it easy to programatically simulate your users’ interactions with your application.
* guard-rspec watches your application and tests and runs specs for you automatically when it detects changes.


## RSpec configuration

    rails g rspec:install

Which creates two files: `.rspec` and `spec/spec_helper.rb`


    # spec/spec_helper.rb
    require "capybara/rspec"

(though we’ll not put this to use until we get into integration testing.)


    # .rspec
    --format documentation

    # config/application.rb
    config.generators do |g|
      g.test_framework :rspec,
        :fixtures => true,
        :view_specs => false,
        :helper_specs => false,
        :routing_specs => false,
        :controller_specs => true,
        :request_specs => true
      g.fixture_replacement :factory_girl, :dir => "spec/factories"
    end

The default `test` folder is no longer needed, so we can delete that (though make sure, if you're working on an old code base, that you're not deleting existing tests)


## Running

Run the command `rake spec` from the application root.

It should say "No examples found", and output that it performed zero examples with zero failures.


## Generate a model

    rails g model Recipe name
    rails g model Ingredient name
    rake db:migrate

The Rails generators create specs and factories for the two models. Edit the two factories to include fake values for their names.

    FactoryGirl.define do
      factory :recipe do
        name { Faker::Lorem.word }
      end
    end

http://rubydoc.info/gems/faker/1.3.0/frames


## Start writing some specs

    it "has a valid factory" do
      expect(FactoryGirl.build(:recipe)).to be_valid
    end

    it "is invalid without a name" do
      expect(FactoryGirl.build(:recipe, name: nil)).to_not be_valid
    end

When we run these specs, they fail... because we haven't added validation to our model to require the presence of a name.

Now it's just a case of writing more tests and code, and learning about Faker, Capybara, Guard, etc. But that's beyond the scope of this lesson.


## Do you want code coverage?

To give you some notification of the lines of your code that get passed over while running tests, you can install the 'SimpleCov' gem:

    gem 'simplecov', '~> 0.7.1', require: false

And configure RSpec to only run it when the environment variable `COVERAGE` is set.

    # spec/spec_helper.rb
    require 'simplecov'
    SimpleCov.start('rails') if ENV['COVERAGE']

To run this now, from the command line call:

    COVERAGE=true rake spec

The coverage files will be generated into a `coverage` folder in the root of the application - you will not want to commit these to git, so add it to the .gitignore file.
