# Cryptic Ruby Global Variables and Their Meanings

How many times have you looked at some ruby code and found strange variable names (eg. $0, $:, etc) and wondered what they meant? Below is a list of cryptic global variable names in ruby and their meanings.

# Environmental Global Variables

## $: (Dollar Colon)

`$:` is basically a shorthand version of `$LOAD_PATH`. `$:` contains an array of paths that your script will search through when using require.

  >> $: === $LOAD_PATH
  => true
  >> $:
  => [".", "/Users/michael/.ruby"]
  >> $: << '/test/path' # Add a directory to load path
  => [".", "/Users/michael/.ruby", "/test/path"]


## $0 (Dollar Zero)

`$0` contains the name of the ruby program being run. This is typically the script name.

  example.rb
  puts $0
  Michael-MacBook:~/Desktop ruby example.rb
  example.rb
  Michael-MacBook:~/Desktop irb
  >> $0
  => "irb"


## $* (Dollar Splat)

`$*` is basically shorthand for `ARGV`. `$*` contains the command line arguments that were passed to the script.

  example.rb
  puts "$*: " << $*.inspect
  puts "ARGV: " << ARGV.inspect
  Michaels-MacBook:~/Desktop ruby example.rb hello world
  $*: ["hello", "world"]
  ARGV: ["hello", "world"]


## $? (Dollar Question Mark)

`$?` returns the exit status of the last child process to finish.

  >> `pwd` # Show current directory
  => "/Users/michael/Desktop\n"
  >> $?
  => #<Process::Status: pid=17867,exited(0)>
  >> `fake command` # This will fail
  (irb):7: command not found: fake command
  => ""
  >> $?
  => #<Process::Status: pid=17871,exited(127)>


## $$ (Dollar Dollar)

`$$` returns the process number of the program currently being ran.

  Michaels-MacBook:~/Desktop irb
  >> $$ # Show process id
  => 17916
  >> puts `ps aux | grep irb`
  michael 17919   0.0  0.0   599780    388 s000  R+    2:51PM   0:00.00 grep irb
  michael 17917   0.0  0.0   600252    680 s000  S+    2:51PM   0:00.01 sh -c ps aux | grep irb
  michael 17916   0.0  0.6    85336  12568 s000  S+    2:51PM   0:00.75 irb


# Regular Expression Global Variables

## $~ (Dollar Tilde)

`$~` contains the MatchData from the previous successful pattern match.

  >> "hello world".match(/world/) === $~
  => true
  >> $~
  => #<MatchData:0x12be0e8>
  >> $~.to_a
  => ["world"]


## $1, $2, $3, $4 etc

`$1-$9` represent the content of the previous successful pattern match.

  >> "hello world".match(/(hello) (world)/)
  => #<MatchData:0x12b06f0>
  >> $1
  => "hello"
  >> $2
  => "world"
  >> $3
  => nil


## $& (Dollar Ampersand)

`$&` contains the matched string from the previous successful pattern match.

  >> "the quick brown fox".match(/quick.*fox/)
  => #<MatchData:0x129cc40>
  >> $&
  => "quick brown fox"


## $+ (Dollar Plus)

`$+` contains the last match from the previous successful pattern match.

  >> "the quick brown fox".match(/(quick) (brown) (fox)/)
  => #<MatchData:0x1294a04>
  >> $~.to_a
  => ["quick brown fox", "quick", "brown", "fox"]
  >> $+
  => "fox"


## $` (Dollar Backtick)

``$` `` contains the string before the actual matched string of the previous successful pattern match.

  >> "the quick brown fox".match(/quick.*fox/)
  => #<MatchData:0x12882cc>
  >> $&
  => "quick brown fox" # The matched string
  >> $`
  => "the " # The text preceding the matched string


## $â€™ (Dollar Apostrophe)

`$'` contains the string after the actual matched string of the previous successful pattern match.

  >> "the quick brown fox".match(/quick/)
  => #<MatchData:0x1280c48>
  >> $&
  => "quick" # The matched string
  >> $'
  => " brown fox" # The text following the matched string


# Exceptional Global Variables

## $! (Dollar Bang)

`$!` contains the Exception that was passed to raise.

  >> 0 / 0 rescue $!
  => #<ZeroDivisionError: divided by 0>


## $@ (Dollar At Symbol)

`$@` contains the backtrace for the last Exception raised.

  >> 0 / 0 rescue puts $@
  (irb):16:in `/'
  (irb):16:in `irb_binding'
  /usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/irb/workspace.rb:52:in `irb_binding'
  /usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/irb/workspace.rb:52
