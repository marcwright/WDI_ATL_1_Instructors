#Tips to make students' life easier

####note taking:
There might be an urge to make a note of everything that we do in the class, however this is not advisory. 
Its useful to jot down bits and pieces here and there, but making note of every single thing will make you miss the point of the lesson. Its much better to be following along, listening and trying to understand as much as possible during the class rather than shifting your focus on the notetaking

####copy-pasting from Hipchat/Word etc:
during such export some hidden chracters set by HipChat/Word/etc get carried through, and they may break your code
one way to prevent this with hipchat is before typing piece of code into hipchat type:
/code <actual code here>
this will ensure not to add any invisible characters
