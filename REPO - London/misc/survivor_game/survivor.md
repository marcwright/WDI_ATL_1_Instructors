# Survivor game (1.5hours)
- Divide students into groups of 5 (use LabPartners app!)

- Each group should come up with a team name.

- Each team will come up with quiz questions related to what youâ€™ve learned thus far. The questions can be definitions or about how to code (not a lot, just a few lines).

- The instructor should select two groups to begin.

- One group should ask the other one of their quiz questions. The group can discuss what they think the answer is, but they may not look at their notes. If they answer incorrectly, they lose a life. If they answer correctly, the team that asked the question has to be able to determine if the answer is correct. If they cannot do that, they lose a life.
  - example: "What are the benefits of DRY programming?" "How do you define a custom exception?"
