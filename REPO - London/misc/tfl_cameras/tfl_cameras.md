#TFL cameras

This app is used to show custom rake tasks (/lib/tasks/tfl_apis.rake). Also it makes intense use of google maps and open data. It is good for the students to see what can be achieved using free datasets. Usually this is given as a homework, giving the tfl_cameras_begin to the students and explaining them that they can use the rask task if needed. The api works like all the images url for the cameras (check final app) are pulled from tfl servers, and are updated automatically on the same url. So the students only need to draw the markers on the google maps with the proper image url in a n info window , then the last udpate of the image should be displayed.
