# JavaScript weeks outline

## Day 1
We start off by showing a couple of methods on the board, and highlighting what's the same and what's different. 
Then we move on to showing some code in the browser console. Finally, we put it all into one HTML file. During the day, 
we build a kind of messy 'playground' HTML file that's got a bunch of event listeners hard-coded into it. 
The rainbow list item is always a big hit; the notes may not cover using setInterval to call it repeatedly, but 
that's definitely worth doing (so a click of the button starts it changing the colours on a regular basis).

- JavaScript basics
- Differences between JS and Ruby
- Basic DOM manipulation
- Object orientation
- Lab: Calc-it basic
- *Homework*: Calc-it advanced


## Day 2
Move on to putting code into its own JS files, and registering event handlers in their own files. Explain the benefits
and use JS modules to compartmentalise the code (talk about global scope). It's worth showing closures here, as it's a 
natural extension, but I wouldn't worry too much about it. 
In the afternoon we moved on to jQuery, talking about the $ "Swiss Army Knife", and showing off what we can do with it. 

- Unobtrusive JavaScript
- Closures/modules
- Lab: Make your calculator unobtrusive.
- jQuery
- jQuery lab: to-do list
- *Homework*: GA ATM & bring headphones tomorrow.


## Day 3
A quieter day today. The HTML5 browser location lesson is a) kind of boring, b) designed to be built on top of the AJAX 
lab from the previous day, and c) doesn't work properly because browsers will fire popState at every single opportunity
and not just when hitting the back button. We skipped this lesson and used it as AJAX review time, because we did AJAX 
on day 3 and it confused EVERYONE. 
The sound manager lesson is always super-popular. Ask students to bring headphones when giving out homework the night before. 

-HTML5 APIs: Window browser location
- Soundmanager
- Lab: Daft Punk sample machine (sounds are in soundkit.zip)
- *Homework*: Night off/practice what you've learnt. 


## Day 4
We did this on day 3, but everyone was SO CONFUSED by AJAX and burnt out after 2 days of new stuff nobody enjoyed it. I recommend 
doing it on day 4 instead, so they've at least got an easier day before hitting yet another hard concept. 

This is only about half a day's worth of lessons, as we did project feedback in the afternoon.

One thing that this lesson includes is the use of a closure to do the yellow fade. Unfortunately this comes right at the end of the 
class, when they've got no brains left, and it's probably easier to do it with CSS transitions these days anyway. 

- AJAX (Stocks app)
- *Homework*: Chat app



## Day 5 
- (Remote forms, Michael). 
- *Homework*: Put JavaScript into your Project 1, OR build a Rails/JS to-do app.
