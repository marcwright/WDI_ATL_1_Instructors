# Reading and writing files (45mins)

## File encryption software

Take a directory of files, from the user and manipulate the content.
You will prompt the user for a directory name, and then for each file in that directory, you will encrypt the contents with [ROT13](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) and overwrite the file.

## Hints

- Do things one step at a time (write cards for each step)
- Get it working for one file... then get it working for all of them.
