The 'Stockbook' app is an example app that can be code-alonged wholly or in part, ideally on Week3 Day1, before Rails is introduced.

It gives an opportunity to discuss conventional folder structures and code organisation in a familiar (Sinatra) framework.

There's also a 'db_base' class which abstracts a lot of the database interactions, in preparation for ActiveRecord, and to appreciate some of what's going on behind the scenes.

# TODO: Write up these notes as a code-along recipe to follow, with points of discussion on the way
