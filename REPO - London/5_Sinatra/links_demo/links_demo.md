# Links Demo (c. 1hr 15m)

This lesson is designed to gain familiarity with routing in Sinatra. Building links that make GET requests and a form which POSTs.
 

The applications we have been writing are cool, but they are just one page. Letâ€™s create an application that has links to multiple pages.

```
    touch main.rb
    mkdir public
    mkdir views
    cd public
    touch public/style.css
    touch views/layout.erb
```

Copy the layout and main.rb frame from previous.

...It could be worth copying this boiler-plate directory, because lots of our Sinatra apps will start off the same way

(walk through the code and discuss/remind the reasons for developing the Sinatra app the way we do)
