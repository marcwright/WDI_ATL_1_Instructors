Dear Previous Graduates,

As WDI homework assistants you have accepted a precarious role. You can recall how daunting the learning task is for the current students, and you are also now much more knowledgable about web development technologies than you were when you graduated.

The balance you must strike is to be on the edge of nudging students forward through their homework exercises, while not giving away the answer, or suggesting techniques that are beyond the scope of what they have covered on their course so far (or just doing it for them, no matter how much they ask!).

So please, bear in mind that "less is more". You are to be their sentient 'rubber duck' [1], and mostly, you will provide a fantastic service by just being a sounding-board for their questions - they will frequently just answer it for themselves while asking you out loud. Try not to give answers... but rather, ask questions that can lead them down the road of discovering the right answer for themselves.

There is no 'right answer' for many of the homeworks - just an opportunity for us to measure what their level of understanding is so far. Whatever they're doing, if it can be provide a working solution, is a 'right answer'.

For instance: what's the 'right way' to solve fizzbuzz? [2]

(Of course, if it's a syntax error, you might just have to point it out :-)

It can't be emphasied enough just how valuable it is to have you there while they struggle through their challenges; the fact that previous, successful graduates are feeding back into the programme is a fantastic benefit. Just having you sit nearby gives the students confidence that they can make it too. So keep that Positive Attitude, and keep being great by encouraging them just the way you are!
