#Recursion

### Learning objectives
* Explain what recursion is and why we might use it
* Explain what a base case is and what a recursive case is.

### Review recursive factorial
* What is a factorial?
* Demo factorial.js
* Draw the code on the board

### [Fibonacci numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)
* Write a recursive function that calculates the nth fibonnaci number
* Write an iterative (non-recursive) function that calculates the nth fibonnaci number

### Single recursion vs multiple recursion

### Bonus: Use recursion to find the GCD of 2 numbers using Euclid's Algorithm
