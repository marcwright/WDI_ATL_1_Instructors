## More Ruby Objects

#### Concepts
- Explain the difference between class and instance methods
- Explain the difference between local, instance and class variables
- Explain what inheritance is and when it should be used
- Explain the use of `self` in Ruby
- Explain the use of `super` in Ruby
- Explain the difference between public and private methods

#### Mechanics
- Write a class that inherits from another class
- Create multi-file Ruby programs using `require_relative`

## Testing

#### Concepts
- Contrast the agile and waterfall approaches to developing software
- Explain what BDD/TDD is and its benefits. Compare it to "cowboy coding."
- Explain what a Unit Test is
- Explain what RSpec is

#### Mechanics
- Read Rspec tests that have already been written for a Ruby program and make them pass one at a time
- Set up a Ruby program with RSpec

Set up RSpec tests using
- `describe`
- `it`

Write tests using expectations
- `to` and `not_to`
- `eq`, `eql`, `equal`
- `be_true`, `be_false`

DRY up Rspec tests using
- `let`
- `subject`
- `context`
- `before`

## Problem Modeling

#### Concepts

- Create a domain model by listing its parts (entities, relationships, attributes and behavior)
- Draw an ERD using proper notation

## Software Design

#### Concepts

Explain and follow the principles of good software design
- Tested
- DRY
- Naming
- Small

## Databases

#### Concepts
- Explain what a database is and why you would use one as opposed to other persistent storage mechanisms
- Explain ACID in laymans terms
- Explain what "auto-incrementing primary key" means for a database table
- Explain what a foreign key is and why you would use one
- Explain what a constraint is
- Describe what `psql` is

#### Mechanics
- Design a database schema

Use SQL to structure your schema:
- CREATE DATABASE / CREATE TABLE
- DROP DATABASE / DROP TABLE
- ALTER TABLE

Use SQL to access your data:
- SELECT
- INSERT
- DELETE

Modify SQL queries:
- AS
- WHERE
- ORDER BY
- SUM
- COUNT
- AVERAGE
