<!--
This form states that it will only be carried out if the user is indeed
signed in as determined by the signed_in? method described in the
sessions_help.rb file.

The form sets the path as being for :session which is the session instance object. The path specified for the request is the signout_path
which we set up in our routes page specifically for the delete method.
The method called is delete which will specifiythe type of request being
passed to the controller.

The form also has some flair by specifying what the name of the currently
logged in user is. Along with a button to initate the request.

Additionally, the signout view has links to the signin and signup pages
if the user is not currently logged in.
