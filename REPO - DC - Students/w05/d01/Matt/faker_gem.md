####Directions

Create a file `faker_intro.rb` in your directory for today. In it, define a method, `gen_random_address` that generates a different address in a single string (with line-breaks) each time it's called. Example output below: 
 
```ruby 
Mrs. Angel Bogans IV
106 Lilliana Tunnel
Apt. 529
North Kaiashire, KY 13869
```
