##API Exploration Homework

Tonight your homework is to research external APIs you're interested in using for your first project. There are a ton of cool APIs out there, but many are poorly documented, and some are downright inaccessible. Therefore, before you start planning your project around an API, it's vital that you make sure that can actually *use* that API.

####Step 1 - Research

Google around and identify 3 or 4 external APIs that provide data you're interested in. If you find yourself uninspired, head over to [Mashape.com](https://www.mashape.com/ismaelc/yoda-speak#!documentation), which has information on a boatload of interesting APIs.

__Note:__ You'll have to register at Mashape.


####Step 2 - Proof of Concept

Head into your personal directory for today and create a `proof_of_concept.rb` file. Within this file, use httparty to access the API(s) you're interested in. 

__Note:__ Some APIs require you to register for an API key. You may need to use this API key when hitting the API.
