## Movie.io

- Build a Ruby on Rails App using the OMDb API

- As a user I want to search for a movie by title and see a list of search results

- As a user I want to be able to click my favorite search result and see more details for that movie so I can decide whether or not I want to watch it. It should display the movie, year, IMDB Rating, FULL plot and poster

- As a user I want to save movies that I like so I can remember to watch them later

- As a user I want to be able to delete movies from my list once I have seen them or don't want to watch them any more
