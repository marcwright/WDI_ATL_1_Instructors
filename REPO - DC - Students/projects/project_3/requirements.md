# Final Project

## Requirements:

* Implements a server-side application with a database.
* Implements a client-side application with JavaScript.
* The server-side and client-side communicate via Ajax.
* The user interface has presentable design and user experience.
* The project is COMPLETE and showable.

## Goal:

**The goal of this project is to build an impressive portfolio piece using the skills that you've acquired during the course.**

Therefore, we suggest that you to use Rails and Backbone to build something polished, rather than building a proof-of-concept with new technologies that you're trying to learn. Ultimately, what you build is your call.

Just remember that a simple, elegant, and complete application looks better in your portfolio than an unfinished project with incomplete vision.
