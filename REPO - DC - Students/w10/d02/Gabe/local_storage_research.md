## Intro to Local Storage

As we do dive into building more client-side applications, we're going to start thinking about how and where we store and manage our data. In doing so, we'll make use of browsers' local storage, introduced in HTML5. Take the next 15 minutes to research local storage, answering the questions below. 

- What is local storage?
  - Answer:
A secure client side storage area, about 5mB in size, which can hold key-value pairs.
It is accessed through javascript by using the array localStorage[];
local storage can only store strings. 

- What problem does it solve?
  - Answer:
Cookies are included with every http request, slowing things down.
Cookies are not secure as they are sent and/or recieved
Cookies can only hold about 4kb data


- What are the alternatives?
  - Answer:
  Storing data in cookies or on a server DB.

- Come up with a scenario in which local storage would be useful.
    - Scenario:
    A web-game in which a player constructs something-- local storage would allow a user to quit -even mid game!- then come back to a game and resume it.
    Local storage would allow some functionality even when off-line!--such as on a messenger app or a collaborative writing or drawing app.

- Think of a scenario where server-side storage would be preferred.
    - Scenario:
    Tasks requiring high security, like banking, should probably use server-side storage.
