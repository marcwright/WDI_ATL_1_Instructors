## Red.it

Create a Reddit-like app for sharing links and upvoting them

### Inspiration:
- http://www.reddit.com/
- https://news.ycombinator.com/
- http://www.datatau.com/

### Directions

Your app should take a URL as input and dynamically get the title (grab the HTML title of the URL).

Once a link is on the list, users should be able to upvote them. It should dynamically sort them from most to least upvotes.
