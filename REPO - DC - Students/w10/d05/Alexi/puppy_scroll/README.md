# [Parallax Scrolling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrolling)

### To Do

* Add a parallax effect by changing the 'top' property of the background div css by a factor of how far the user has scrolled. HINT: we are going to have to use `$(window).scrollTop()`. Read about [.scrollTop()](https://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/)
* Add more parallax effects by changing the 'top' property each of the images css by a different factor of how far the user has scrolled. The kittens and puppies should move.

### Bonus

* Play with different scroll speeds and effects. Try changing left, right, or other CSS properties.
* Play with changing the CSS transform property. Check out rotate, transform, and scale
* Tinker with the CSS positioning and z-index to change what appears in front of what.
