## Partner Activity - ZIP Code
Parter up and take a stab at writing a ruby method, `is_valid_zip`, that validates a user-submitted ZIP Code, keeping in mind that ZIP codes can be 5 digits, as in 20008, or 5 digits followed by a dash and four more digits, as in 90210-0876. Anything else is invalid, and should result in the method returning false.
