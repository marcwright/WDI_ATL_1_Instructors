Use Ajax to load data from the Spotify API! A user should be able to:

**Basic Requirements:**

 - Enter a keyword to seach for.
 - Select "album", "artist", or "track" as the search type.
 - Have the names of all search results print as a list.
 - When the user changes the search type selector, reload the results list based on the new search type.
 
**Keep going:**

 - Add a "Showing X-X of X results found" message.
 - Setup pagination links for accessing the next page of results.
