## Lord Of the Rings Autoplay with jQuery

We're going to use our newfound knowledge of jQuery and JavaScript Timers to build a self-governing version of The Fellowship of the Ring, complete with soundtrack.

####Objectives
- to get reps manipulating the DOM with jQuery (ie: don't rely on raw JavaScript; you've got jQuery!)
- to get experience making dynamic use of JavaScript timers
- to gain additional familiarity with the Chrome Developer Tools (ie: console + debugger + the elements tab);

####Directions

1. Open up `fellowship.js` to find explicit instructions on how to build middle earth
1. Follow the step by step instructions, making use of your new jQuery tools
1. Build this project out one function at a time. Check that each works before moving on to the next.
1. Once you're sure each function works, link them with timers, so that each invokes the next!
