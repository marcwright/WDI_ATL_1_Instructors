## TDD Change Maker

* Using TDD, write a method `make_change` that takes a number of cents as input and in returns a combination of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

* Note: return the combination that takes the least number of coins

## Bonus
* Have your make_change handle cases of innapropriate input
* Write a method make_cents that takes  a set of coins as input (pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters) and returns the total number of cents that they add up to
