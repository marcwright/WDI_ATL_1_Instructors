        <h1>Capture and Share the World's Moments</h1>
          <p>Instagram is a fast, beautiful and fun way to share your life with friends and   family.

          Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and feel, then post     to     Instagram &mdash; it's that easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter,   Tumblr   and more.     It's a new way to see the world.

          Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?</p>
