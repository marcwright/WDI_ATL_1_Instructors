  <h2>How We Use Energy</h2>
  We divide our energy use among four economic sectors: residential, commercial, transportation, and industrial. Heating and cooling our homes, lighting office buildings, driving cars and moving freight, and manufacturing the products we rely on in our daily lives are all functions that require energy. If projections are correct, we're going to keep needing more. In the United States alone, energy consumption is expected to rise 13% over the next two decades. Global consumption is expected to increase by 44% over the same time period.

  <h3>Home & Work</h3>
  Residential and commercial use accounted for 41% of the energy consumed in the United States in 2008.
  Where does the energy consumed in homes and commercial buildings come from? And what is it used for? Discover how energy is used to power our lives where we live and where we work.

  <h3>Transportation</h3>
  71% of all petroleum used in the United States goes to the transportation sector.
  With less than one twentieth of the world's population, the United States is home to one-third of the world's automobiles. Learn about the impacts of our dependency on vehicles and the fuel we use to run them.

  <h3>Industry</h3>
  Industry accounted for 31% of the energy consumed in the United States in 2008.
  Industry is vital to our economy&mdash;and it requires a lot of energy. Find out which industries draw the most from our energy supply and what sources they rely on to power their processes.

  <h5>Energy Defined</h5>
  Ethanol (or Ethyl Alcohol)
  Best known as the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, it is produced in large quantities through the fermentation of the sugars and carbohydrates in agricultural crops and blended with gasoline as an alternative to conventional oil-based fuels for motor vehicles.
