# Post-class Workflow

As we wrap up our time together in the classroom, your learning workflow will be a lot more self-directed. To help focus your time, especially over the next couple of weeks, we've put together this guide on how to approach it and stay effective.

## Scrum with each other @GA!
* Spent 15 minutes each day to:
  * Review what you accomplished the day before
  * Plan what you are going to tackle that day, however big or small.
  * Identify anything that might be blocking you and figure out what needs to happen to remove those blockers

## Self-assessment
* Review your self-assessment on a regular basis and chip away at all the stuff you are unsure about little by little

## Personal Portfolio Site
* Keep working on and polishing your portfolio site

## Github Profile
* Make sure that the repos you have in your public Github profile are documented with descriptions / READMEs

## Keep Building
* Continue writing code and building apps. I'm sure all of you will want to continue working on your final project to either add new features, refactor, or improve testing.
* Build open source projects; grow communities. People will be impressed by your contributions.
* Make it a goal to open your terminal every day. We've learned an incredible about over the past 3 months, and most likely all of it hasn't quite cemented in your brain yet. It's critical that you keep practicing because you will start to forget quickly if you don't. Keep forward momentum!
