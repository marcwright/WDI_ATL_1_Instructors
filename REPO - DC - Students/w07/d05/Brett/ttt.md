# Tic Tac Toe

Build a Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript.

### Step 1
Build the "model" first. You should be able to play the entire game from the command line.
This part should be pure JavaScript. You shouldn't need to write any HTML or use jQuery.

### Step 2
Build an interface for your tic tac toe game so that you can play the game by clicking on squares.
