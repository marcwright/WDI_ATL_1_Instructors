JavaScript is ridiculously liberal in what it allows. The idea behind this design was that it would make programming in JavaScript easier for beginners. In actuality, it mostly makes finding problems in your programs harder, because the system will not point them out to you.

Contrary to what the name suggests, JavaScript has very little to do with the programming language named Java

ECMAScript describes a general-purpose programming language, and does not say anything about the integration of this language in an Internet browser. JavaScript is ECMAScript plus extra tools for dealing with Internet pages and browser windows.

That leaves 52 bits3. Any whole number less than 252 (which is more than 1015) will safely fit in a JavaScript number.
