# I want to go through the student roster, student by student, touching on each student's name and saying out loud, "HIS_OR_HER_NAME is a student who is learning to learn"

students = ["Adam Barrett","Jacob Cain","Mikael Davis","Salil Doshi","Jon Eva","Elaine Fang","Parker Hart","Richard Hessler","Mary Hipp","Inhak Kim","Randy Latz","Yi-Hsiao Liu","Alexi Phillipson","Matt Rundo","Gabe Snyder","Stephen Stanwood","Joella Straley","Brett Wallace","Thomas Weaver"]

students.each do |student|
  puts "#{student}"
end
