# Saved By The Bell: The Newest Class
# Create a file called saved_by_the_bell.rb
# Begin with this simple data structure representing your class: students = ["Adam Barrett","Jacob Cain","Mikael Davis","Salil Doshi","Jon Eva","Elaine Fang","Parker Hart","Richard Hessler","Mary Hipp","Inhak Kim","Randy Latz","Yi-Hsiao Liu","Alexi Phillipson","Matt Rundo","Gabe Snyder","Stephen Stanwood","Joella Straley","Brett Wallace","Thomas Weaver"]
# Write a program that:
# beings with a comment identifying what type of data structure students is.
# prints "STUDENT_NAME is learning to learn." for every student in the class
# prints "STUDENT_NAME is the student in the STUDENTS_INDEX_VALUE index" for every student in the class
# What tool will you use? If you don't know, where will you look?
# Finds and prints the number of students in the class
# What tool will you use? Again, if you don't know, where will you look?
# Finds and prints the index of "Stephen Stanwood"
# Prints the fifth person
# # Prints all of the students with J names (Jacob, Jon, and Joella)
# 
# '''''''''''''

# 
# I would grab a piece of paper and write "saved_by_the_bell.rb" at the top. I would write a list of all the students in my class and number each student. I would then proceed through my list and state each person is learning to learn.
