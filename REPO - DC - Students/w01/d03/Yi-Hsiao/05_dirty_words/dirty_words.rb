# ## Dirty Words

# Here's an interesting challenge: test a phrase against an array of dirty words to see if it raises any red-flags. Use `dirty_words.rb` as a starting point for this exercise.

# 1. Prompt the user with **"Go ahead, say your worst:"**, and then accept an input sentance from them.
# 2. Convert their sentance to an array of words.
# 3. Check if any of their words are flagged as dirty words.
# 4. Print one of the following outcomes:
#   * **"We're rejecting that, you potty mouth."**
#   * **"Okay, we'll publish that."**

# ## Nowâ€¦

# Do it without nesting any enumerable blocks inside one another.
