## Let's Play High-Card-Wins

Game time! Create a new file called `high_card.rb` for this exercise.

**Methods to research:**

* `each_with_index`
* `max`

**Tasks:**

1. Build a deck of shuffled cards… maybe you can leverage some old code? *Hint: you may want to add some additional card data!*
2. Collect an array of player names by prompting:
	* **"{n} players so far. Enter a player name, or type 'play':"**
	* Maybe you can leverage some old code here?
3. Upon *"play"*, deal each player a card.
4. Find the highest card score dealt (Aces high).
5. Find the winning player name, then print out:
	* **"Winner(s): {name1, name2, …}!"**
	
### Bonus…

Print out *one* of the following outcomes:

* **"The winner is {name}!"**
* **"It's a tie between {name1, name2, …}!"**
