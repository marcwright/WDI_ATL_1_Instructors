1) What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you during WDI?

There are times when a specific aspect of a lesson doesn't interest me as much as others. I will sometimes
zone out during those parts of lessons, and this can cost me down the line when a deeper understanding of
that aspect is needed.



2) How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?

The benefit at WDI is that I am very interested in a large part of what is going to be covered. 
I know how interconnected everything is is when it comes to this field, and I've seen how much easier
my life will be by being able to do all aspects of what we'll cover. I think that knowing these facts will
will push me to focus on everything, and dig in deeper to understand the things I have trouble with.
