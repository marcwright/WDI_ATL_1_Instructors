# Directions: You're all adults with 20+ years of experience as learners,
# and you know your learning patterns best. Please answer these two simple questions,
# keeping your entire learning history in mind.

# 1) What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you during WDI?

=begin

(1) While I'm generally a pretty focused person, I get more easily distracted when sitting in front of a computer.

(2) When I've coded in the past I have often fallen into obsessiveness and don't necessarily know when to step away and take a break for a bit.

(3) I know that I learn most effectively by taking notes rather than by just listening, but sometimes trend toward the latter once it gets later in the afternoon.

=end

# 2) How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?

=begin

(1) I'm going to close my computer whenever possible and take a lot of notes by hand.

(2) I'm also going to set a time at night (8 PM or so), when I'll head home regardless of what's going on and do something else in life.

(3) Am going to eat lots of snacks over the course of the day to stay alert (keeping the bloodsugar up and whatnot).  At this point, I also know enough to take notes/listen actively rather than being tempted to ease off and try to just passively absorb information.
