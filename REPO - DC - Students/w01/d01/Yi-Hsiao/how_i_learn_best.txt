# Directions: You're all adults with 20+ years of experience as learners,
# and you know your learning patterns best. Please answer these two simple questions,
# keeping your entire learning history in mind.

# 1) What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you during WDI?


1. I can make decisions too quickly before learning everything I need to know about a situation.
2. I cannot focus on too many tasks at one time.
3. I don't retain knowledge very well through memorization.

# 2) How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?

1. Ask questions and research topics thoroughly.  Don't assume that I know everything about the topic yet.
2. Minimize distractions and focus on the present task at hand.
3. Do problem sets on codewars.com and use flash cards daily to help retain knowledge.
