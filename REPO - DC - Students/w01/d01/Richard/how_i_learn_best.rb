# Directions: You're all adults with 20+ years of experience as learners,
# and you know your learning patterns best. Please answer these two simple questions,
# keeping your entire learning history in mind.

# 1) What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you during WDI?
<<<<<<< HEAD
# I'm easily distracted by the 'home environment' and will justify not studying/practicing/continuing work
# by finding something else to do - the procastination of the programmer.

# 2) How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?
# I'm incredibly dedicated to succeeding in this class and in the role of the Web Developer.  With that in mind,
# do not plan on leaving the campus until close, or unless I've finished my work/completely understand the concepts
# of the day's work.
