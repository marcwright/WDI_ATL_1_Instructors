# and you know your learning patterns best. Please answer these two simple questions,
# keeping your entire learning history in mind.

# 1) What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you during WDI?
  Over the years I have become exceptionally proficient in the art of procrastination. Alone those lines my time management skills are also questionable.





# 2) How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?
  I've found that I procrastinate more when my mind is fatigued. Physical exercise has helped tons as a way to clear my head and when I return I'm far more disciplined in doing my work .
