# Directions: You're all adults with 20+ years of experience as learners,
# and you know your learning patterns best. Please answer these two simple questions,
# keeping your entire learning history in mind.

# 1) What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you during WDI?

Throughout my learning career I've found that I can unknowingly erect mental firewalls when learning
something new, usually born out of intimidation or frustration.  I've never really 'not' been able to
learn a concept or function, however sometimes I will arrive at the end result and think to myself, 
"I may have grasped this sooner had I mellowed my mind".

# 2) How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?

Ending my day with something other than coding will work wonders.  I have been known to induce stress
dreams and set my mind to work on non-existent problems by working on something right up until climbing
into bed.  Meditating and reading before bed will help mitigate this.
