# Directions: You're all adults with 20+ years of experience as learners,
# and you know your learning patterns best. Please answer these two simple questions,
# keeping your entire learning history in mind.

# 1) What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you during WDI?
# I think that whenever I don't get enough sleep, I can't give the class enough attention, which
#would seriously hinder me. This happens because I give time to other things that I want to enjoy,
#in consequence of being too stressed out. I wouldn't be as stressed out if I didn't procrastinate.
#This wouldn't happen as much if I let myself off the hook. But I am learning that if I don't
#push my luck, my overall happiness and producitivity would skyrocket.





# 2) How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?
#I have found that whenever I get some exercise, it can fix the way I work drastically. Whenever
#I exercise, I go to bed at a reasonable hour, my focus gets much sharper, and I can do homework
#assignments much faster, and more productively.
