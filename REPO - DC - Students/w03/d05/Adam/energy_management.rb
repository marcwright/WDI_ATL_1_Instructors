# What's working


#Staying after class to work on the homework with my classmates. Going to bed before 11pm to get enough sleep/rest in order to function properly. I haven't done this but I need to pack my lunch so I can rest my eyes during the hour long lunch break to break up the day.

#What's NOT working

#Drinking more than two drinks in the evening - this pretty much speaks for itself. I've done it twice since starting the class and I shouldn't do it again. I need to get more exercise - I think it will make me feel naturally happier and healthier when sitting in the classroom and relieve stress as well.

#Leaving 'early' so I can do something (i.e. walk my dog, go get dinner, go play basketball, go to HH) - Once I leave for the day I never find myself opening my laptop once I get home for the evening. I REALLY need to stay on campus until I finish my work for the evening.

#I need to stop smoking SO MANY cigs. I know I'm not going to 'quit' right now in my life but the number I smoke a day has recently gotten out of control. Please don't ever comment/checkup on it though.
