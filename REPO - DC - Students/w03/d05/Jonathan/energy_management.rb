# ENERGY MANAGEMENT
# ===============================================================

# A) What's working ...
# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Effiency in my morning preparation and commute allows me to sleep
# a little bit longer. Switching to commuting on the Metro has
# allowed 20 minutes of excersise per day (walking to the Convention
# Center). Staying away from getting together with friends on weeknights.

# B) What's not working ...
# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Jumping directly into my homework and not taking a break.
# My diet, I need healthier choices and more snacks. This
# is also a result of "jumping into the homework" (too much PBJ)
# Too much coffee and not enough water. Not getting together
# with friends on weeknights.

# Note: Crazy and petty but ... I like the seat I sit in. I'm a
# creature of habit. I could probably sleep another 25 minutes
# if I knew I could sit in my regular seat everyday :)
