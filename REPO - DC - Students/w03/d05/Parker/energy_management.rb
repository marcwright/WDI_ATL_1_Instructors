ENERGY MANAGEMENT 

What's working: 

Setting a solid schedule consisting of a morning run/workout and pre-review of my notes and homework. This combination works only with a solid 7.5/8-hours of sleep.

Coming to class prepared to learn and focused on what is being instructed. Asking questions of my classmates and teachers.

Doing my homework at the office hours with the caveat that I have a daily cap on time spent. It is not the quanity of hours spent studing but the effectiveness of the hours spent studing. 

What's not working: 

Worrying what the teachers or faculty think of my work or how i am progressing in my studies. I need to believe in the system and focus.
