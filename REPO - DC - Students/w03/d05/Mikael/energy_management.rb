  A: What's working?
  -Tackling the homework immediately after class definitely helps to cement in the concepts that we learned during class by allowing me to practice before it starts to slip away.
  -Frequent breaks throughout the day also allow my mind to breathe when we're learning particularly dense concepts.
  -I've also found that closing my laptop and setting a time to stop working on homework/code every night helps me to relax and focus on other parts of my life.
  -I'll maximize these things by continuing to schedule them in, so that there's some type of structure around my time after class every night. And I'll make sure that when we do take breaks, that I take advantage of them.

  B: What isn't working?
  -Not getting enough sleep/staying up too late.
  -I can minimize/eliminate this by scheduling my time a little bit better and going to bed earlier than necessary. For me, extra time in the morning due to waking up early is more useful than extra time at night from staying up late.
