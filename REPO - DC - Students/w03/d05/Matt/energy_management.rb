### A - What's working

# 1 -

### B - What's not working

# 1 - I've been going to bed way later than I should be. I need to start
  # doing a non-electronic activity at least an hour or so before I go to bed.

# 2 - I have been waking up way too late too. I've only been late a couple times so far
  # but I could probably be more awake for the start of class if I got up earlier and had
  # some type of breakfast.

# 3 - I've been eating dinner really late - after I leave office hours. I could probably
  # bring dinner and save time. My concern is not having enough time to utilize office hours
  # but I could probably solve this concern with better planning.

# 4 - I haven't been able to work out or play hockey. Those two activities are big ways I can get
  # my mind off stress. My hockey games would be during the week and between 9 and 10:30, so I have
  # knew coming into the class I wouldn't have the time - which is fine. However, I could probably
  # find time to go to the gym after office hours.
