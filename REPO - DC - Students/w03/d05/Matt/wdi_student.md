# WDI Student Rspec

### Prompt

A student has a name, an amount of knowledge (out of 100), and an energy level (out of 100). A student starts with a name, 0 knowledge, and is chock full of energy. A student can choose to either code or take a break. Coding increases your knowledge, but takes away from your energy. Coding does not increase your knowledge if you are tired to begin with (what numeric value constitutes 'tired' is up to you). If you take a break, you won't be tired anymore. 

### Bonus

If you plan right before you code, you can code twice in a row without getting tired.
