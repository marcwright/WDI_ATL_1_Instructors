1. What's working:
-- I ask lots of questions in class
-- I find it helpful to talk about the problem with someone - especially to conceptualize and place the problem in the larger context of what we're learning

2. What isn't:
-- I often don't "get" the assingment until later on in the night. Once I understand the homework, it's usually a matter of time to complete it. Occassionally I don't complete the homeowork because I just don't know how to move forward, but more often I run out of time. Most nights I stay up late trying to complete the assignment and I am just not getting enough mental rest or physical activity. For whatever reason, I feel compelled to start working on the homework right after class. Either because everyone else is or what I've learned is fresh on my mind. I am probably experiencing diminishing returns on these non-stop efforts.
  - I need to stop working on the assignment after 10pm, even if I know I can do more
  - I need to take effective breaks after class is over. I should probably get a YMCA membership, and take a PT break between 5 and 6pm.
