So far, it's hard for me to say exactly what's working and what isn't because I haven't really taken the opportunity to sit down and reflect on everything I've been exposed to over the last three weeks.  It seems like the things that I have gotten better at or developed more of a comfort level with have been a result more of osmosis than repetitions.  I do feel like I need to spend more time on my own, digesting things for myself.  So far I've spent a lot of time working with others, which is very helpful.  However, there are times where it feels like too much is going on around me, and some time alone to process things would go a long way.  Another thing I struggle with is striking a balance during class between trying to process mentally what's being taught and trying to make sure I transcribe things correctly in note form to refer to later.  So far I think I've sacrificed note-taking and coding along for the sake of being able to simply listen and pay attention to what's being said and grasp it conceptually, but often to the detriment of being able to refer to notes later on down the road.  Moving forward, I think I would benefit from the following adjustments:
1.) Spend more time on my own (perhaps on the weekends) rehashing things from the previous week to make sure it's not all just a big jumble.
2.) Take more notes during class, particularly when I don't understand something.
3.) Utilize the Google spreadsheet more in order to more effectively compartmentalize the things I'm struggling with and keep everything we've learned so far organized in my head.
