#
#A) What's working?
#
#  --I'm getting enough sleep;
#       I usually get to bed at an hour early enough
#       to ensure that I can actually learn the next day.
#       I've made it a priority.
#
# --I feel like I'm making progress;
#       The classwork is engaging and challenging, but I
#       am giving it %100. I am feeling extremely optimistic,
#       and excited to gain more skills and begin what I see as
#       a long process of learning to code/develop and make apps!
#
# --I don't feel like I need to compare myself to anyone;
#       Since I will be trying to find work in Baltimore after
#       this course, I already feel as if my goals are set apart from
#       most people in this class. Its a nice mental 'out' I use to
#       escsape those feelings of status anxiety.
#
# B) What isn't working?
#
# --Study sessions / Office hours;
#       I am still trying to find my ideal daily commitment to
#       of 12th floor study and office hour time. I dont always
#       feel like I get a lot from being upstairs, but I can't say
#       my home studies are much better. I cant quite say what
#       it IS that I want--I only know that I don't yet feel
#       satisified with the situation.
#
# --My commute;
#       It is actually working O.K., but I mention it because it is
#       a huge augmenting factor in my experience of this course. I am
#       extremely dedicated to this course, but the fact that I sometimes feel
#       anxiety about catching a train home at night can distract
#       me (or actually interrupt for a moment) from what I am trying to do --LEARN!
#       I commute approximately 80 miles a day. It takes about 3 hours a day.
#       During that time I often do homework, read, or try and chill out,
#       but it is notably NOT time that can be called 'relaxing'.
