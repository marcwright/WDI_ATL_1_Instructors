## Self-Improvement Homework

#####Step 1:
Review your self-assessment from last week. If you haven't filled it out yet, do so. This is mandatory.

#####Step 2:
Target 10 concepts or mechanics you feel unsure of, and write them into the numbered list below.

#####Step 3:
Research all of the items you listed, and write in either an explanation (if the item is a concept), or the necessary code snippet (if the item is a mechanical question).


1. - Explain what a fork is and why we would use one.
  In Github to fork a project will create a "copy" that you can then modify independently without affecting the master copy. This may be one of your own repositories, someone else's open source repository, or a private repository that somebody else has shared with you.

2. - Clone a repository from Github.
    "git clone git@github.com:whatever folder-name'


3./4.- Read data in from a file and parse it/- Write data to a file
    "http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/File.html"
    Not very unfamiliar with it, just not fluent with it.  We have only had one assignment where we've worked on such, so the concept isn't engraved yet.
    The ruby docs will be a solid reference for me in the future.

5. - Explain what object-oriented programming is.
  I know that in ruby every'thing' is an object, but the concept is evading me.
  "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that represents the concept of "objects" that have data fields (attributes that describe the object) and associated procedures known as methods. Objects, which are usually instances of classes, are used to interact with one another to design applications and computer programs"


I know you wanted 10, but out of the list only 5 really stood out as something that I can relate to having an obvious difficulty with handling.  Those listed above will be reviewed and solidified in the upcoming day or two.

I even have been able to green-out the rest of my list after second review!


__NOTE:__ This is mandatory
