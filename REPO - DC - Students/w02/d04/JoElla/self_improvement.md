## Self-Improvement Homework

#####Step 1:
Review your self-assessment from last week. If you haven't filled it out yet, do so. This is mandatory.

#####Step 2:
Target 10 concepts or mechanics you feel unsure of, and write them into the numbered list below.

#####Step 3:
Research all of the items you listed, and write in either an explanation (if the item is a concept), or the necessary code snippet (if the item is a mechanical question).


1.  fork vs. clone vs. remote
When you fork someone else's code, you've put a copy in your GitHub account.  To actually work on the code, you need to "clone" it to your own machine.  The copy on your local machine now looks at the forked code on GitHub as "origin".


2.  Explain what a hash is and WHY you would use one
Hashes are useful when you want a collection with elements that can be accessed by name.  (Was trying to figure out if there were any additional hidden meanings here)

3.  explain yield
Yield allows you to supply a little extra block to your method when you call it -- the example I read online that helped most was a method for printing numbered lists.  Sometimes you might want the number itself to be formatted differently, so if there's a "yield" in the main funciton, you could supply the alternate formatting in a block after your method call statement.

4.  Explain what inheritance is and when it should be used

One class can "inherit" traits from a parent class.  This could be used when the child class shares things in common with the parent, though I've also read "metaprogamming" quickly becomes more complicated than useful.

5.  Create a domain model by listing its parts (entities, relationships, attributes and behavior)

"Domain" means all the things related to a specific problem, or maybe the realm of the problem itself.  The diagram makes note of the type of relationship between entities (one/many).

6.  what is a mixin?
A class which contains a combination of methods from other classes.

7.  difference between before & let in rspec
Before builds an instance before each example, whereas Let creates variables as they are called for.

8.  add new stuff to a hash?  use .merge

9.  what's a unit test?  testing one thing at a time?

10. what is "subject" in rspec?


__NOTE:__ This is mandatory
