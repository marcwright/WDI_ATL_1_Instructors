## Self-Improvement Homework

#####Step 1:
Review your self-assessment from last week. If you haven't filled it out yet, do so. This is mandatory.

#####Step 2:
Target 10 concepts or mechanics you feel unsure of, and write them into the numbered list below.

#####Step 3:
Research all of the items you listed, and write in either an explanation (if the item is a concept), or the necessary code snippet (if the item is a mechanical question).


1. If x = 3 & y = x, is there any way to change x without changing y as well?

2. Mechanics of enumerator (yeild) : In Ruby, methods may receive a code block in order to perform arbitrary segments of code.When a method expects a block, it invokes it by calling the yield function.

3. attr_reader : creates instance variables and corresponding methods that return the value of each instance variable

4. attr_writer : creates an accessor method to allow assignment

5. attr_accessor : same as setting both attr_writer & attr_reader for an instance variabe

6. rspec - difference between select & let : let sets a new instance to a variable that applies to all tests, and select just creates a new instance (not set to a variable) at start of each test

7. Fork an existing repository : do this from Github using buttons; not a git command

8. Clone a repository from Github : is done through git; git clone <link to master>

9. self : self is usually implicit but is important to use when defining a method if you want it to be a CLASS method instead of an instance method

10. why will || return whatever value is true instead of just "true" : When used in a context where a boolean is expected, Ruby evaluates objects that are traditionally non-boolean (like strings) as boolean.


__NOTE:__ This is mandatory
