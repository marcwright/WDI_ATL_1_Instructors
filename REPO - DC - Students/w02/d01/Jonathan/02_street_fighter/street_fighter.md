# Street Fighter

Model the arcade classic, "Street Fighter". Complete this exercise within the provided `street_fighter.rb`:

1. Extend **Fighter** into multiple fighter subclasses, each with their own special combos and attack moves, as follows:
	* **Guile**
		- "ASSA": Sonic Boom
		- "ZZZX": Flash kick
	* **Chun-Li**
		- "XZXZ": Lightning Kick
		- "AXXZ": Spinning bird kick
	* **Blanka**
		- "SSAA": Electric Thunder
		- "XXZA": Rolling Attack
2. DRY out your implementation as much as possible, keeping as much code as possible defined once in the Fighter abstract.
3. Isolate the private/protected interface.
4. Test the outcome of your actions on each specific character!
