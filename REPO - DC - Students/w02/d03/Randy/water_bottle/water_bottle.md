# RSpec Water Bottle

###Prompt:

Using TDD, develop a __Water Bottle__ class given the description below:

* When a water bottle is created, it is empty.

* A water bottle can be filled. 

* A water bottle can dispense water unless the bottle is empty. 

* Dispensing water from the bottle empties it.

#### Okay, cool. Now:
* Change your code so that each time you fill the bottle, it is good for 3 sips instead of just 1.

* Peruse slides 1 - 20 of this [RSpec resource](http://jakegoulding.com/presentations/rspec-structure/
) which explains how to use `context`, `before`, `let`, and `subject`. Save and commit your work, then go back and refactor your tests with your newfound knowledge.
