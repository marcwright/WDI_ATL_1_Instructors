4)Name and Points per game (points/games), for the players with the top 20 points per game

SELECT name, points / games FROM players; —selects all players names with all points per game, unordered;
SELECT name, points*1.0 / games FROM players; —returns much more accurate float point results;
SELECT name, points*1.0 / games FROM players ORDER BY points DESC; —gives you ALL ordered results;
SELECT name, points*1.0 / games FROM players ORDER BY points DESC LIMIT 20;—almost, but is sorting by points, not points per game.
