## D3 Visualization Alternative

The focus of this project should be on learning D3 and the visualation of data. That said, if you're struggling to find a workable dataset, you should probably move on. Here are two sample datasets to draw upon.

- [IMDB TOP 250 By Rating](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_DC_1/blob/master/w11/d03/INSTRUCTOR/imdb_movie_ratings.csv)
- [IMDB TOP 250 By Gross](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_DC_1/blob/master/w11/d03/INSTRUCTOR/imdb_movies_gross.csv)

#### Directions
Use the data above to create a page with a Headline of "Top 25 Movies", and create a bar chart that displays the 25 movies and their rating or gross. Allow the user to toggle between these two options. 

__Note:__ The top 25 are different, so don't display both at once.
