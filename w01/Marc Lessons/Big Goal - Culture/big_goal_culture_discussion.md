Previous rules:

* Class Rules:

  1. Respect fellow classmates and instructional team.
  2. One person talks at a time during teaching time.
  3. We expect you to attend all lessons and labs. Please inform the instructional team in advance if you know you will miss a session. (to qualify for post-course opportunities, only 2 days )
  4. Arrive on time. Latecomers really distract the class.
  5. No distracting games or videos (You will be silenced).
  6. Silence mobiles. Absolutely no calls in class.
  7. Instructional team will be patient and courteous with students.
  8. We should encourage a collaborative environment within the classroom.

* Expectations:

  1. You will need to work after hours to keep up with the course work.
  2. Take advantage of the instructional team, we are here to support you.
    a. obviously in class time
    b. but also via hip-chat if weâ€™re online
  3. Help each other, you will be experiencing the same problems.
  4. Make your mistakes in the classroom, this will help you to develop.
  5. Repetition is the key, especially in the first three weeks.
  6. Do class exercises, labs, homework. Additional apps on top of this will be an advantage.
  7. Be vocal about things you do not understand. Chances are you will not be the only person in the same position, we will reiterate until everyone understands.
  8. Try and blog or keep a diary of your progress. This will help you understand your own progress.

* Explain that Winter is coming. A commitment is necessary. The students have made the space and time necessary in their life, they can now do anything. Passion! Ideas to the world!
* There is no morality in working vs. non-working code.
		
		There is nothing "good" about working code, and there is nothing "bad" about code that is not working. Whether or not some code is working should not be a measure of how good it is. Students tend to think this way since life has probably worked that way for them until now (when you take a test, wrong answers are bad, and correct answers are good). However, in software development, we need to encourage students to realize that quality of code stems from deeper topics of code organization, semantics, and other principles of, as we call them, good code. We need to instill the idea in them that broken code may be excellently written, but broken because of a missing comma, just as code may work but be terribly organized and highly unmaintainable.
* We must instill confidence
* Celebrate errors
* Encouragement, find the wins
* It's OK to pivot
* We're on the same team - we're peers, learn from each other
* Lightning talks
