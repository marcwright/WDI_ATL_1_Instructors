# Guest Book

Create a Ruby Program with a menu. The menu has 3 options: 

1. Sign the guestbook
  * This prompts the user for their name and adds it to the guestbook
2. View the guestbook
  * This prints the names of all the people who have signed the guestbook
3. Quit
  * This quits the program. The program should not quit until the user says they want to quit.
