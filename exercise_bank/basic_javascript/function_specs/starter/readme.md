# Function Specs

Let's run your Jasmine test suites through the command line. To get started with the command line, you'll need NodeJS and NPM installed (you should already have them).

Once you have Node and NPM, run:

```
sudo npm install jasmine-node
```

After that, you can cd into your test directory and run tests using:

```
jasmine-node spec
```
