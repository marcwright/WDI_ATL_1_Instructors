#Morning Exercise - Shape maker

### Write a Sinatra application

#### Phase 1:
- Should have a response for a `get` request to '/'
- The page should display a blue square (any size)

#### Phase 2:
- Add a form that appears on every page so that you can enter the number of squares that you want and submit that. The form should take you to the '/multiple' page
- Your app should have a response for a `get` request to '/multiple'
- The page should display the number of blue squares (any size) that are passed in to the parameter `:num`

#### Bonus
- Experiment with other CSS shapes (circles, ovals, triangles)
- Augment your form so that the user can specify what number and what shape they want
