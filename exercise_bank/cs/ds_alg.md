### Data Structures & Algorithms

- Explain what an algorithm is
- Benchmark code in Ruby to compare which code runs faster
- Explain what Big O time complexity measures and why we would use it
- Describe how a Bubble Sort is performed and it's time complexity
- Describe how a Quick Sort is performed and it's time complexity
- Explain what a divide and conquer algorithm is
- Describe a few basic data structures: Lists, trees, and graphs

### What is an algorithm?

* Series of steps / instructions to perform a task
* Computer Algorithms & Human Algorithms
* Can get really complex and we care about speed. Why?
* How do we measure speed / efficiency?
* Ruby Profiler will tell us how long something takes.
* We also have Benchmark which will allow us to compare 2 things.

### What is Big O time complexity?

* For Loops - O(n)
* Nested Loops - O(n^2)
* Consecutive statements - Add the big O's
* If/Else - Big O of the worse one

### Sorting under the hood!

* Create cards numbered 1 - 12. Give each one to a student and have them stand at the front of the class in a random order. Have them self-sort according to the algorithm.
* Bubble Sort w/ cards
* Share Code w/ benchmarked bubble, implement quicksort
* Quick Sort w/cards
* Profile Bubble vs Quick vs Ruby
