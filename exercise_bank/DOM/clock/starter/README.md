# Tick Tock

A JavaScript & jQuery refresher. A lot of you mentioned needing more practice with setInterval.

### To Do

* Rotate the second hand every second so that it does a full rotation in 1 minute
* Rotate the minute hand so that it does a full rotation in 1 hour
* Rotate the hour hand so that it does a full rotation in 12 hours

### Stuff you will need to look up:

* JavaScript setInterval
* The CSS transform `rotate`

### Bonuses:
* Use the JavaScript Date Object to initialize your clock to the current time
* [Check out different easings for your animation so it doesn't look so jerky](http://easings.net/)
* Refactor the clock hands so they are pure CSS instead of images
* Use CSS @keyframes for your animation instead of using JavaScript's setInterval
* Play with other CSS transforms besides `rotate`
