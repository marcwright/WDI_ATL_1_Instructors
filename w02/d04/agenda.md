  - Intro & Framing

  - 1st session: ping pong
  - Goal is to just get used to the problem, Rspec syntax
* 10:15 - 10:30 break/reflection
  - modeling can be a trap - paralysis/analysis (this isn't waterfall)
  - it's just a first pass at breaking down the problem - you don't need to solve all of the problems up front. Don't have enough information.
  - part of emergent design is getting a clear picture and then figuring out 
  - kind_of - is this a useful test? what if the implementation changes. We want to test behavior
* 10:30 - 11:15 2nd session: ping pong
  - What is the appropriate data structure? 2-D array? Cell class?
  - notice how you approach the problem, and how your partner approaches it differently, and how you handle that
* 11:15 - 11:30 break/reflection
* 11:30 - 12:15 3rd session: ping pong (evil coder)
  - find the loophole
  - good tests!
* 12:15 - 12:30 break/reflection
  - what effect did it have on your code?

### Framing

##### Why?
  * Sense of wanting to get it done causes us to cut corners
  * Not going to try something you don't know how to do since it slows you down
  * You aren't writing the "best" code you can

##### Goal is to
  * Shrink gap between how you code and your ideal perfect code
  * Really apply TDD to a problem
  * Get more comfortable with Rspec
  * Learn to program together

#### How?
  * Purposeful practice
  * Problem is designed to keep you from getting the problem done
  * Accept that you aren't going to get it done
  * If you write one line of code, one method, it is okay!
  * Practice writing better code, when the pressure is on, you'll be better
  * You'll pair with 6 people. It is wonderful. It will change the way you see something and you program.

##### Focus on: 4 Rules of Simple Design
  * Tests Pass - Verify that your code works
  * DRY
  * Reveals intent / Naming
    * "There are two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors"
  * Small

##### Logistics

  * 45 minute sessions, pair programming
  * Hands off keyboards
  * Delete your code
  * Quick retrospective, share ideas
  * Swap pairs
  * I'll be adding constraints later in the day

### Closing

##### The Closing Circle

It is important to get together at the end of the day and reflect. The standard way if to have a closing circle where everyone answers 3 questions. Depending on the size of the group, you'll want to emphasize brevity. With 20-30 people, it can potentially take a while.

##### The Three Questions

What, if anything, did you learn today?
What, if anything, surprised you today?
What, if anything, will you do differently in the future?
